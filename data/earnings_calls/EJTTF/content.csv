Johan Lundgren,0,"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for coming here today to easyJet's 2018 Full Year Results. My name is Johan Lundgren, and you would already know Andrew Findlay, who is the company's CEO here.
And I also have a lot of prominent guests here from the company as well, with John, our Chairman. I saw you earlier. Just maybe I didn't hear you. John, I was just introducing you. You made a, yes, very good. And then I also have my colleagues here from the executive team [indiscernible]. And if you haven't had a chance to speak with them prior to this presentation in the copy, I would suggest you do so because there's a huge wealth of experience within that team as well, and I'm really pleased to have them also in place for the year to come.
Now I'm really pleased to say that this has been a fantastic year for easyJet, particularly in the context of an industry in somewhat of a turmoil. I've been here almost a year now, and we have achieved a lot in that year.
Our headline profit before tax increased by 41%, meaning our underlying profits, excluding acquisitions, was a record for the company. The structural advantage means we have increased revenue by 17%, with both passenger and ancillary revenue performance being very strong.
Cost control has been strong, £107 million in savings this year, and we've been recognized in Europe as the best-value short haul airline by Skyscanner, and our brand has continued to strengthen this year as the best airline across all our markets.
Across the whole of the network, we continue to be in the strong positions, with an additional 7 airports added to the list of airports where we now have a number 1 positioning. We have successfully acquired a start up operations at Tegel, which was a fantastic effort by the team.
Overall losses were slightly better than first expected, and we are now the number 1 airline in Berlin. And despite the fact that it's been a difficult summer for disruption across the industry, we have seen a small increase also in customer satisfaction. Combined, if you take all of these things into consideration, I think it's very clear that easyJet has outperformed everyone in this sector for 2018. I'm therefore pleased that we can also say that we will be recommending a 43% increase in the dividend to our shareholders.
Earlier this year, we also identified 3 big areas where we can drive margins and returns, and we're now making good progress when it comes to holidays, business and loyalty initiatives, and I will come back to those later on. All this will be underpinned by the investment we will do in data, with the objective to become the most data-driven airline in the world.
While the disruption remains a major challenge for the whole of the industry, we believe we are leading the in-the-route response with a comprehensive integrated program, investing in a more resilient operation to decrease the impact on our customers. It is currently our biggest priority, along with the focus on Brexit, of course, as well as safety. And we see it, actually, as a major opportunity, and we'll come back to talk more about that later on.
We're investing in people, and easyJet has never been in such demand by cabin crew and pilots. We've had over 75,000 applications from pilots and cabin crew to join us, which is close to 8,000 more than we received the year before. So all these talks and the discussions about the fact that though there's a pilot shortage, that doesn't at all apply to ourselves, and we'll come on to talk about that also more in detail. We also have, as I mentioned earlier, we have a new leadership team who have the right expertise and experience to deliver on the strategy.
Finally, we also have positioned ourselves extremely well in a period of uncertainty. We have a strong investment-grade balance sheet with GBP 396 million of net cash. We are well prepared for Brexit, and I'll talk more about that later in this presentation. Our fleet position is both flexible and advantageous, and we have today confirmed an order of 17 aircraft with Airbus. Our fuel hedging position gives us a high degree of certainty, also, over the next 18 months.
And really, to summarize this, you take all these things as a snapshot, we are a structural winner; we have great foundations that we can continue to build on, which we'll talk more about this in this presentation; we have plenty of opportunities to go for.
And with that, I'm going to hand over to Andrew."
Andrew Findlay,0,"So thank you, Johan, good morning, everyone.
Before I start, I just wanted to highlight that this presentation will be the final time we split out the financial performance of our Tegel operation. As we ran through the slides, I'll make sure to keep you updated on exactly what is being presented.
Starting off with some performance highlights, which includes the Tegel operation, our total capacity grew by 9.8%, with passenger numbers reaching 88.5 million, an increase of 10.2%. Overall loads have increased for the year, with the load factor up 0.3 percentage points, despite the lower average load in Tegel, reflecting the rapid start-up of operations.
On a total reported basis, revenue per seat was up 6.4% and up 4.7% at constant currency. The result has positioned us at the high end of guidance ranges provided through the year. Our total reported headline cost per seat was up 4.4% and at 2.7% at constant currency, reflecting the wet lease operation at Tegel as well as the difficult disruption environment experienced through the year. I will give you more detail in revenue and costs later in the presentation.
Finally, easyJet delivered a headline PBT per seat increase of 28.7%, GBP 6.07, highlighting the continued strength in our underlying strategy.
Moving on to the income statement. As with the previous slide, the Tegel operation is included in the numbers provided.
Total revenue increased by GBP 851 million for the year, which reflects a combination of our capacity growth, a strengthening euro as well as a strong trading performance. Total headline costs, excluding fuel, increased by GBP 559 million, which was mainly driven by increased capacity, a strengthened euro, inflation linked through pay deals, which we have highlighted earlier in the year, but high levels of disruption. This was partially offset by cost initiatives, including a continued leverage of our scale of airports and other benefits driven by our cost and efficiency program.
Fuel costs increased by GBP 122 million, reflecting increasing fuel price through the year, which was partially offset by our advanced hedge position. As a result, despite the headline loss associated with our Tegel operation, easyJet has delivered a headline profit before tax of GBP 578 million, which is GBP 170 million improvement on last year. Excluding the Tegel acquisition, we delivered a headline PBT performance of GBP 690 million, a record for easyJet.
In terms of non-headline costs, it was a GBP 133 million impact for the year, the largest elements being the GBP 65 million for the commercial IT platform, as we take a more flexible IT approach to securing future commercial revenues; GBP 40 million of Tegel integration costs; and GBP 19 million accounting interest associated to the sale and leaseback of 10 A319 aircraft in the period.
Now moving on to the detail of our revenue per seat performance, and this excludes Tegel.
Revenue per seat at constant currency was up 6.7% for the year and was driven by 3 main factors. We estimate the combination of Monarch bankruptcy, the issues experienced at Ryanair and the French industrial action delivered a £1.98 impact for the year, being circa 3.4 percentage points.
Ancillary revenue delivered a sustainable £1.34 increase, through the ongoing benefits of last year's improvements, including our new holdback proposition, with differential pricing for 15- and 23-kilogram bags.
And finally, underlying passenger revenue was strong, driven by our network brand, customer service and attractive fares. When we include the impact of ForEx, easyJet's reported revenue per seat, excluding Tegel, increased by 8.3%.
Moving on to costs, again excluding Tegel. Total headline cost per seat at constant currency was up 2%, and excluding fuel, was up 3.8%. In terms of the detail, I'll start from the left-hand side of the chart.
The first bar reflects the impact of doing business at large regulated primary airports, which underpins our network differentiation. The increase in crew costs to £0.56 reflects the inflation pay deals we highlighted earlier in the year, the negative productivity impact of canceled flights and significantly better crew retention rate than expected. Higher depreciation charges, but interests on the coupons turned ownership costs up by £0.18. These factors as well as underlying cost inflationary pressures combined to drive costs £1.94 per seat higher in the year.
To alleviate these cost increases, we doubled our efforts on delivering cost saving measures. Increased mix of A320 and A321 aircraft in the fleet delivered a saving of £0.29 as we added 45 A320s and 2 A321s to the mix in the year, meaning, we still have a significant opportunity to deliver cost savings. Our year-end average gauge finished 172 seats.
2018 saw a continued focus on delivering sustainable savings through the easyJet cost and efficiency program. The next column represents the cost reductions delivered in the year, which included enhanced long-term effort and ground handing deals, engineering and maintenance savings, overhead efficiency to improve process and structure, with a focus on increased automation, for example, Auto Bag Drop facilities.
We have a strong pipeline of cost-saving measures in place, which will drive efficiency and maintain our position as one of the low-cost leaders in the industry, particularly through the primary network that we operate. Combining all the factors just mentioned would have led to a cost per seat ex fuel at constant currency increase of 1.1% for the year, which was in line with our original guidance.
The next column highlights the higher bonus payments across the business as a result of our financial outperformance in the year. And then we move on to disruption costs, which had the single biggest impact on cost per seat ex fuel in 2018.
We do everything we can to ensure we look after our customers during these disruption events. As such, these costs also include welfare costs that we bear when having to cancel flights for ATC strikes and severe weather with a €250 compensation payable. Johan will give you further details on disruption and the initiatives we have underway to address it later in the presentation.
Finally, fuel costs per seat fell by £0.52 at constant currency despite the market increase, reflecting the impact of our hedging policy and increased aircraft gauge. The impact of foreign exchange increased cost per seat by £0.88, primarily due to the weakness in pound against the dollar.
Moving on to some of our Tegel operation -- detail of our Tegel operations for the final time. As I've said previously, we are extremely happy with the progress made through the year to deliver a very challenging plan of building a 23-aircraft base in about 11 months. The smooth launch of such a large base is testament to the outstanding operational capabilities we have within this business. And this illustrates that easyJet is set up to deliver a smooth transition if another opportunity like this arises in the future. 
In 2018, we flew 3.9 million passengers from Tegel, delivering a load factor of 80.6%, which reflects the rapid ramp-up of their operations, with tickets not going on sale until December 2017. Load factor levels are increasing as we expect, and we hit around 85% during the summer months. We made headline loss before tax of £112 million for the period, which is a solid performance given the factors already mentioned, with our total loss before tax of £152 million, coming in lower than our original guidance, reflecting a ramp up of operations faster than we originally anticipated. In terms of operational measures, our performance is excellent. OTP of 82% for the period has been strong and would have been higher if it wasn't for the difficult year of disruption, mostly across Europe. 
Our recruitment and trading was executed to plan, and as at 30th of September, 665 easyJet pilots and cabin crew were working at the base. We will continue to optimize the schedule and operations throughout 2019 and into 2020. This slide summarized the impact of fuel prices, currency and hedging. The average market price for jet fuel for the year was $664 per ton, an uplift of 33%. After taking into account our commodity and currency hedging, the sterling cost of fuel per metric ton was £434, which is a £22 or 5% increase compared to 2017.
Moving on to foreign exchange. The euro rate fluctuates between €1.10 and €1.16 during the year. And net-net, there was an 8, there's a headline of £8 million positive impact from currency movements, which includes those within the revenue, fuel and other cost lines. easyJet continues to generate strong sustainable cash flows, with operating cash flow reaching £1.2 billion, which funded the return of £162 million to shareholders through the payment of the 2017 ordinary dividend. Our working capital benefited from a combination of our higher revenue per seat, changes of ticket sale timing, plus an improvement in supplier payment terms. 
Our investing and financing activities include the generation of £106 million via the sale and lease back of 10 A319s. This contributed towards £977 million of captured investment, primarily on new aircraft. You can see the split between growth and replacement aircraft as well as other CapEx, which includes engineering and maintenance spend, plus investments in systems as well as the €40 million invested in Air Berlin Tegel assets. Rated at BAA1 and BBB+, we continue to have one of the strongest balance sheets in aviation, which provides resilience, flexibility, plus access to cheaper unsecured debt. 
During the year, fixed debt has increased by £615 million, principally representing the investment in new aircraft, offset by the sale and leaseback of 10 A319s. At the end of the period, 71% of our aircraft on balance sheet, with 98% of those being unencumbered. Looking at our cash position, easyJet ended the period with £1.37 billion in cash and money market deposits and borrowings of £977 million, resulting a £396 million of net cash. Our liquidity is supported by the $500 million revolving credit facility as well as a further £250 million RCF, which was taken out for the year. Most of these RCFs have no covenants or accrual stops. We also have business interruption insurance of £150 million to cover a range of large short-term shock events, which also supports our liquidity buffer. 
As at the 30th of September, our liquidity position was £3.9 million for 100 seat versus our minimum liquidity target of £2.6 million for 100 seats.
This slide summarizes our forward jet and currency fuel hedge, currency hedge positions. Although recent increase in fuel price will impact us in the short term, based on the hedging disclosure of our competitors, we expect to be significantly advantaged over the next 12 to 18 months as a result of our current hedge position.
Moving on to our fleet plan.
Today, we announced an agreement with Airbus that converts 17 purchase rights into firm orders, securing valuable slots at a time when the Airbus order book has limited availability. So the agreement includes the exercise of purchase rights for us to firm orders for 17 A320neos under the existing framework agreement signed in 2013, the deferral of delivery dates of 18 A320neo aircraft by up to 24 months, and the conversion of 25 purchase rights for A320neo into purchase options to ensure delivery slots in 2024.
As a result of this agreement with Airbus, we have increased our forward flexibility and have a range of outcomes over the coming years [indiscernible] continuing our yearly capacity growth of somewhere between 3% and 8% per year over the medium term. The flexibility in our plan will allow us to maximize our PBT per seat and cash generation, also showing we continue to grow capacity in our key markets. This chart illustrates that flexibility.
This chart summarized our growth CapEx over the next 4 years. It reflects our current fleet plan, including the delivery of 30 A321s, of which 2 were delivered in 2018, and a modest investment in parts to aid resilience and fleet recovery. Our policy for hedge aircraft purchase is once they become committed, and we are currently hedged for circa 88% of FY '19 aircraft delivery payments. In Q1 this year, we anticipate entering a further 10 A319 sale and leaseback, in which we anticipate raising between £100 million and £150 million, which is not reflected in this chart.
Moving on to forward bookings. For 2019, 50% of our half 1 seats have been booked, 1 percentage point behind the same time last year, which is a strong performance considering the increasing of Tegel flying, the movement have eased into half 2, and a one-off increase in bookings experienced from Monarch and Ryanair issues in the first half of FY '18. A first took at half 2 booking positions shows we are slightly ahead versus the same time last year.
This slide shows the expected capacity growth, plus the European short haul network through the winter. Please note this information shows some OAG and includes the easyJet flying from Tegel airport. As you can see, the short haul capacity is expected to grow by around 6% in the half, with easyJet reaching double-digit figure, percentage growth, mainly due to the impacts of Tegel flying, which represents the majority of our growth in the first half.
In terms of competitors in our routes, we are expecting an increase in capacity of circa 4.3%, with last year's figures reflecting the demise of Monarch and Air Berlin, and the reduction of U.K. domestic routes by Ryanair.
In addition to previous slide, I've added this chart to give the breakdown of easyJet growth for the half. Starting from the left, 4% of growth reflects the annualization of route capacity from FY '18, the continued investment in building our number 1 and number 2 positions of prime airports as well expanding our network through airports and routes that would deliver margin-accretive returns. Prior-year cancellations and up-gauging represent a combined 3% uplift. And finally, the strategic investments in Manchester where we're considered there taking a strong position following the demise of Monarch, and in Tegel where we will fly a full year schedule for the first time.
So moving on to the more detailed line-by-line outlook slide, as a reminder that this guidance includes our Tegel operation.
2019 capacity, expected to increase by circa 10%. On a like-for-like accounting basis, revenue per seat for the first half is expected to be down by low to mid-single digit, in line with previous guidance. This includes the effects of annualization of one-off revenue benefits from the 2018 financial year, dilution from Berlin and the effects of Easter moving into the second half of the financial year. Adjusting for the prospective impacts of IFRS 15, revenue per seat in the first half is currently expected to be down by mid-single digits, mainly due to the treatment of booking fee revenue, which is now recognized at the time of flying and which will benefit the second half of the year, as well as the revised treatment of EU261 compensation costs, which are now partially offset against revenue.
So on a-like-for-like accounting basis, total headline cost per seat, excluding fuel at constant currency and assuming no more levels of disruption, is expected to be flat for the 12 months to 30th September 2019. This includes expenditures on the strategic initiatives to drive margin and returns in the long term.
Adjusting for the prospective impacts of IFRS 15 again, total headline cost per seat, excluding fuel at constant currency, expects to improve slightly, as some disruption cost is offset against revenue, as noted above.
Based from the exchange rates highlighted, we expect a headline GBP 10 million year-on-year adverse impact for the full year. Full year unit fuel costs are expected to be GBP 50 million to GBP 100 million a year adverse. And finally, total CapEx for 2019 will be circa GBP 1 billion.
IFRS 16, the new accounting standard relating to leases that we have chosen to adopt early in financial year '19 is not expected to have a material impact to the income statement as the annual operating lease expenses and maintenance charges are anticipated to be replaced by similar levels of depreciation and interest expense. However, it should be noted, the adjusted net debt at the 30th of September 2018 will be circa GBP 600 million lower than reported, as the capitalized leases will be -- we will recognize in our balance sheets going forward are significantly less than the 7x estimate used at our calculations. We anticipate for FY '19 that this will have a positive impacts on headline return on capital employed of circa 1.5 percentage points.
I will now hand you back to Johan."
Johan Lundgren,0,"Thank you, Andrew. So what I like to start off with is to introduce you to our plan. This is something that we have recently introduced into the business. And the purpose, really, of this is to refresh and simplify what we have said previously, to get everybody in the organization focused on the clear set of priorities and also promises that we're making to our stakeholders. But we also came up with a purpose, and I think this is really, really important for our organization, where so many of the people in the organization are facing our customers on a daily basis. So the purpose that also capture, in part, the business study, it's seamlessly connecting Europe with the warmest welcome in the sky. And this is something that's going done really, really well within the organization.
We got a clear framework of the 5 priorities that is shown on the page here, and I'm going to talk you through those a little bit later as well, and that gives us really the clarity and the focus on what we are going to do to be successful. And then the promises, the 5 promises that we also have in here: the safe and responsible; on our customers' side; in it together; always efficient; and forward thinking, it's really the things that describes how we do things in the easyJet way.
Now if you're looking at the 5 priorities, they are building upon the structural advantages that easyJet currently has. We will continue to build #1 and #2 position to strengthen our unique network at primary airports, where we give our customers a travel experience that means that they want to travel again and again with us. And we are investing in new initiatives that offer them more reasons to do so, within holidays, business and loyalty. And we will continue to focus on costs, but also in efficiency, in every part of our organization. We want to track and invest in the right people in the organization. And we want to accelerate also our investment in data to improve the customer offer, drive revenue, reduce costs, and improve operational excellence and efficiency.
These priorities -- this is important, these priorities doesn't work only in isolation. I think it is when all these things comes together, that you'll see that they will bring and add up more to the sum of their part, to really maximize the customer experience and, therefore, also maximize the returns to our shareholders.
We will consistently measure and report our progress against those priorities with 6 KPIs, which you can see on the bottom of the slide, that are all aligned to the success and the sustainability of the business. We've done a big work within the organization to be absolutely clear what are the things we want to measure to make sure that the right people have the right things to look to see that we can evolve and measure the progress about what we do from the strategic point of view and also from a shorter-term point of view.
So let me talk you through these priorities. The first of this priority -- and by the way, there's no priority among the priorities, just to get that straight. They're all equally important as priorities for us.
The first one is to be the number 1 or number 2 in primary airports. And with this slot portfolio that we have, we have, absolutely, Europe's leading point-to-point network between the continent's primary airport. The range of destinations that we have, the frequencies which we fly on gives our customer a fantastic offer, and as a whole, are also extraordinary difficult to replicate. You got to think about this that this is something that's been built up now since the airline started in '95, and therefore, these slots are physical assets that actually somebody can't just take away from yourself.
We have a number one or number two positions at 24 out of the 29 bases and out of 51 out of the 156 airports that we serve. And the percentage of our capacity that touches a number 1 airport has increased, from 79% to 88%, in the year. And as I mentioned before, we became number 1 at 7 additional airports this year, including Tegel, Bordeaux, and Lille as an example. This investment in the network is delivering increasingly strong returns, with contributions up 20%, on average, since 2014.
But we get plenty of things to go for as well, and by gaining more and more share in attractive primary airports and offering more frequencies and more destinations, we can increase the returns and we believe that we can compete successfully with anyone in the market.
The track record we have of successful growth and increasing returns drives our future investment plans. Where we have a number 1 and number 2 positions, there are 60 million seats flown by legacy airlines in and on easyJet routes, and that gives you a sense of the great opportunity that we still have to progress in this area.
We're well established already in the airports that are largely slots constrained. And with our average seats gauge growing from 172 seats currently and further increasing over the coming years, growing at slots-constrained airport is an advantage that we can benefit from, unlike many of our competitors. This is before you consider that we have also other opportunities elsewhere, including some of those airports that you will see on the slide there on the right. Our next priority is to win our customers' loyalty. Today, easyJet, as we know, we have a great offer, we got a great brand that drives customer loyalty, and loyal customers are very valuable to us. 
We better understand what they want. And they come back to us at a lower cost. The attractive network, our award-winning value, continual innovation in our offer and our great customer service that is delivered by an amazing group of people that we have on board our aircrafts. You see brand scores that show that we are the best value airline in Europe, with a number of awards this year that reflect this. And over 2/3 of consumers in key European markets state that they would seriously consider to fly us over our competitors. And I think that's an amazing stat and tells you, and gives evidence of that opportunity we have. 2/3 of these consumers in these markets say they will seriously consider flying with us over any other airline.
2018 has seen the highest level of consideration to date in UK, France, Germany. And in Berlin, perceptions around the easyJet brand have significantly improved, with a 6 percentage point increase in serious consideration since last year. This is all reflected in our revenue performance, a 6.4% increase in total revenue per seat and an 11.7% increase in ancillary revenue per seat. Loyal customers fly twice as often and spend more than double with us. It also drives increasing loyalty. Last year, we had 58 million seats booked by customers, but also booked in the previous 2 years. That is an increase with 11 million. We will continue to invest in evolving the customer experience and leveraging our brand in strong markets with the aim of returning, sorry, of retaining and growing our customer base and increasing spend per passenger. 
And as I said in May, this gives us a huge opportunity to drive significant profits and returns over the next 5 years. We will build on the strong foundations of the core of the business, of the core of the airline, leveraging the customer base that we have, and then, in addition to that, build on that brand with investments that we want to do now and we are doing within the holidays, business and loyalty. So let me talk you through these initiatives, and I'll start with holidays. As you may recall, we had 0.5 million customers out of 20 million who fly to our top 29 destinations that books a hotel through easyJet. This is despite low current investment, a suboptimal technology experience and a low level, if any, level of personalization. 
This is a massive opportunity for us, and we will radically improve on how and what we currently offer to capture that opportunity. We will base this on our unique and highly attractive fundamentals: a pan-European network of destinations and frequencies fly many times through the day, many times through the week, to city, beach and ski destinations; an efficient, flexible, low-cost operation that we have within the airline; and a great trusted brand and a loyal customer base. And this is combinations that you take all of these things in consideration as a whole, you will not find in any airline that is out there. You might find parts of this that fits with some of our competitors. When you put all of these things in together, there is nobody who can compete with these fundamentals, and that's what we want to continue to build on. 
We also have, on top of this, now a team of industry-leading people and expertise. We have the ability to develop an offer that is tailored, that is personalized and offer fantastic value and, therefore, capture a significant share of this market.
Now let me talk you through a little bit more in detail what this will look like.
Since May, we've had an interim team in the business who made good progress in 3 main areas, where the aim is to improve the experience and take direct control of specific part of this value chain. And what you can see from this slide is, actually, the description of the values [indiscernible] that you see on top of the slide and then you have, from, where we basically are today. And at the bottom of this slide, to, is where we aim to go as we're progressing our efforts in this area.
We're moving to a more targeted, better user experience offering where we have a clear idea of what we want our hotel offer to be. And we've had also, I must say, a number of discussions with some of the most in demand, some of the most loved hotel partners in Europe. And with absolutely no exceptions have they said that they are absolutely just thrilled to engage in a commercial relationship with ourselves, which is a fantastic start for what we want to do, and this is exciting and this is very positive.
We also have a very clear idea of the technological experience that we will offer our customers. And we now have, as I mentioned earlier, also a team in place. Gary Wilson joined us here as, last Monday. He's already been in this company for more than a week. Time flies.
And we also have, in addition to that, we appointed a CFO. We have a head of marketing, we have a head of customer, head of PR. And we also had a great addition in from James Hardie, who comes from Jet2, who will head up our e-commerce and digital. And we work together both with the airline and also support also the activities we do within the holidays team. So I'm really excited about how we are going to move this forward as well.
So what we plan to do is then, in '19, launch the new easyJet holidays prospect. And the big next season will be 2020, but we will continue to roll out and evolve the improvements in the offer, starting from now and over the next 18 to 24 months. But that is the timescale that we can prepare ourselves for when you're going to see more news coming in from easyJet holidays.
Let me talk to you about business. Our customer tells us that when you meet people who travel with us business today, and I've seen some of them in focus groups, and what they tell is very clearly say that, look, easyJet is the smart contemporary way of travel of business in 2018. And I think that, that is at the core of the offer what we do, but it reflects also the customer experience that we give today, which is based on that point-to-point network at the primary airport, with the frequencies that we have on all the major commercial routes, which, of course, now also includes Tegel.
We built this business customer base from 10 million in 2012 to over 15 million in 2018, and an increase of 17% versus 2017. That is just on the year-on-year growth between '18 and '17, but we can do more than that. By developing also a great product, offering a seamless convenience at great value that is consistent with the easyJet way of doing things, we will target many more of the short-haul business customers who fly in Europe every year.
Our objective is to increase the business penetration on the business network. And we're already starting to make schedule improvements on a much more granular level and much more to a larger extent than we have done before. From Berlin, we, for example, now serve from both airports in Berlin Charles de Gaulle. We are launching Zürich to Tegel. We've added Berlin to Bastille, as an example. We've added first wave and last wave departure from Bordeaux to Nice. And I could go on about a number of things we're doing here to really enhance the schedule for business passengers. We are also starting to fly Gatwick to Düsseldorf, coming in January, all really something that will attract more business customers flying to ourselves.
We already done a number of the improvements that I mentioned at the half 1 that we need to do, just to make ourselves to become a better alternative and partner to work with for companies. We are now able to separate the VAT invoicing, which was a big hurdle for us in Germany, and we've also looked to do a number of other things. Launching a corporate portal that would come out also in 2019 that will help establishing our presence within this market. And I think one of the big drivers of this is, clearly, also to look how loyalty fits into this, and the schemes, and the recognition, the reward we want to do for our most loyal customers.
So we do have a large and a loyal customer base today, and we do have existing loyalty programs that are very popular. The invitation-only program that we have with Flight Club is for those who fly, basically, more than 20 times a year with us has increased by 45% in 2018, and it's over 9% now of all easyJet bookings that's coming from people who have booked as Flight Club customers.
easyJet Plus, which is our paid membership program that allows customer to access additional privilege for an annual fee, increased the membership by 52% also in the year. But they are still quite limited in the scale and it's still quite limited in terms of the value that it provides.
And the opportunity is that if you take a look at 2018, that 66 of easyJet customers have flown with us in the past 2 years. Returning customers buy twice as many flights per year as first-timers, but just under half of easyJet's customers today only travel with us once a year.
Our easyJet Plus and Flight Club members have consistently driven incremental year-on-year revenue. And we want to grow value by customer, by recognizing and rewarding them, which we'll drive and we will set up to make sure that, that drives contribution to our bottom line.
We have appointed now also our first ever head of loyalty, and we're assembling also a team under that person to deliver a program that encourages customers to spend with easyJet and our partners, to redeem points to get access to exclusive rewards, and then also to be recognized and advance quickly through the loyalty levels we have in order to access further enhanced benefit. And this is something that we intend to roll out also during 2019, and we believe it will make a great, also, part of the offers we're doing within holidays and also within the business.
Third priority is value by efficiency, which is equally important to driving the profit per seat. And as Andrew has showed you earlier, one of our biggest cost drivers this year has been the disruption costs, which have increased by almost GBP 70 million in 2018, and that is clearly all included in our numbers.
Our cost and efficiency program continues to drive both short-term efficiencies and longer-term structural cost savings across all areas of the business, leveraging the increasing scale that we have. The program has been able to deliver large and sustainable savings, £107 million in savings this year and over £0.5 billion savings has been achieved since 2011. We will continue to invest in efficiency and invest in systems and processes that drive operational excellence, support reliable decision-making, reduce complexity and use data to make better decisions faster.
Operational efficiency is key to any successful organization, and we see a great opportunity for improvement in this area. And quite frankly, it is so that customers are not willing to pay for any inefficiencies in any organization. And we will do a lot of things to make sure that we continue to be even more efficient as we go forward.
In addition to this, we're also investing in highly efficient next-generation aircraft that deliver up-gauging benefits of around 1% cost per seat per year, 15% fuel savings compared to prior-generation aircraft and 50% less noise, which is attractive to many airports and customers in Europe.
Let me talk to you about disruption. Disruption has been the single largest driver of non-fuel cost increases and customer dissatisfaction across the entire industry over the past 4 years. And as you can see and as you would know, this is an industry issue that really affects everyone in the sector and all the airlines.
It's driven by a lack of investments in systems, chronic understaffing, Europe's ATC centers, regular strikes in both ATC and ground handling, and congested airspace with no spare capacity due to inefficient use. So this is really about how the current airspace is being used. It's not like that there isn't enough of aerospace, it's a fact that it's not being used as efficient as it could and as it also should be. And that means that it's a big knock-on impact when disruption occurs.
Network delay minutes have increased by 5.8% per year on flight on average across the last 5 years. And there were over 27,000 canceled flights for all airlines across Europe during a 6-week period during the summer, 1st of July to the 12th of August, which gives you a bit of an idea of what difficult summer this has been.
But we do see this as an opportunity, and I'll describe why that is the case. We started talking about that, and I think we were one of the first airlines to really come out early to say that this is a big, huge issue, not only from the cost perspective, but also on the way that this impacts on our customers. And I think that we have taken the lead in setting out also plans to tackle the issue.
Two years ago, we actually started taking about taking the first steps to reducing the impact for the customers and reducing the cost involved in this. And although this has helped, it hasn't been anywhere near enough where we need to be to really crackdown on this topic. So we have initiated the most comprehensive, the most integrated program we've done in this area to ensure that we can cut and reduce the cost of this and involved in this and that we have, basically, a program that involves touch points across the whole of the organization.
We recorded the Operational Resilience Program, and its focus really on 3 key strategies: to build, to execute, and to recover. The build is really to invest intelligently in the schedule, in our aircraft, in our crew to deliver more resilient operation. Execute focus on delivering a robust operation through a combination of data-driven predictive tools, including automation and optimization. And the recover, focusing on improving the customer experience during disruption, minimizing the impact and preserving the customer satisfaction. 
And there's this huge number of self-help initiatives that we will be investing in, which will include modifying schedules to improve overall resilience; increasing the standby aircraft availability; focusing on the first wave departure to minimize the delay minutes as the day progresses; implementation, automation and data-driven decisions, making it available across the organization through the use of our own time performance simulator; developing strategic partnerships, such as in ground handling with DHL to deliver better processes and equipment levels into the contracts with our ground handlers; improving operational and customer communications across the operation control center, ground handlers and crew. And the operational resilience program is really there to deliver reduced costs and minimize the impact on our customers.
Let me talk to you about people, the right people. We are investing significantly in people to make sure we have the right people to take this business forward. On our aircraft, I think it's fair to say, and I'm sure everybody who has traveled with us before know, and I hope that you've all done that as well, that we have a fantastic crew. Our crew stands out from any other of the airlines crew that is out there. And they are a big part of what customer thinks about when they are looking to what value we represent. We have an amazing customer engagement scores in our, among our crew across the company. 
And in a trial that we have done on a new employee listening tool, Peakon, our cabin crew Net Promoter Score was 41, which is an exceptionally strong result, which is also a reflection of what I said earlier in the customer satisfaction score that we see on board. Looking at the A and B, who sits there, we clearly have also invested in industry-leading experts into the core of airline, in the holidays and the business and the loyalty teams. They're great employee retention. At 6.5% turnover for the whole of the business and under 5% turnover for flight deck, that gives us a great opportunity and certainty that we can continue to grow with people who wants to come to work for this company. 
I said earlier, 75,000 applications from pilots and cabin crew to come and join this company. So this whole thing about there's a pilot shortage out in Europe aviation, that doesn't exist for ourselves. We've had more applications than ever. It's an increase, actually, in applications of 8,000 versus 2017. Glassdoor features also easyJet now in the top 50 places to work in, as, in the UK, as voted by our own people and our own employees. And within that, we are also the #1 airline. So we have invested a lot, and we will continue to invest to make sure that we are the most attractive partner and company to work with within this space. And the 4.2 star rating, that puts us ahead of Unilever, Waitrose, SAP, and PWC as an example. And it's only with the right people that we're going to be able to obtain outstanding and successful and sustainable results for our business.
Fifth priority is innovating with data. And this area encompasses all of the priorities I've already talked you, taken you through. And it's important, it is highlighted in the vision that I stated earlier, to become the most data-driven airline in the world. The investments we're currently making will enhance the use of data to improve customer experience, drive revenue benefit, reduce costs and also improve operational efficiency. And I'll give you some of the examples now of what the data team is currently working on.
With pricing and market forecasting, we are driving revenue opportunities by improving demand forecast and to deliver competitive pricing, not only on the ticket, but also on the ancillaries products, such as seat allocation as an example. Our service optimization will enhance our customer experience through data-driven decisions for the onboard food and beverage. The networks and the flight scheduling, we're also developing a lot of our ability to make the most out of the fleet that we have and the network that we have today to make sure that we can drive and make effective decisions around managing disruption, as an example, by implementing the tool that's called Optym. And Optym is really a planning solution that we are aiming to introduce in full here for 2019.
So what Optym does? That is really a software tool that take commercial and operational data constraints and variables into consideration to make sure that it gives us an automated view on how we can look at the schedule in different way. In basic, gives us a number of opportunity of what the schedule should be like, so we know what the outcome could be with different types of schedule. Really helps us to make that trade-off between the commercial value of what we do and also the operational performance, such as on-time performance, as an example.
Data will also help us to minimize the impact of disruption by using automation and machine learning, predictions of delays to find the best solutions. During this year, we also developed our own OTP simulator, which is a fantastic tool. So what it does is that, basically, after the first wave, we can take the performance of the first wave and then see what actually the changes we should do, give them the constraints and the congestions that will be taking place in Europe, what this means for us throughout the rest of the day, so we can earlier take decisions on the changes we want to make throughout the day to therefore minimize the disruption and therefore also decreasing costs.
Luca Zuccoli who also sits here today, our new CDO. He joined the company in August, and he continues to add to an already strong team to recruit and a large number of data scientists, not just data analysts. And this is important. We have a huge number of capability that we are waiting to bring into the company to already add onto the strong team we have within our data department. And I know no other commercial airline who is invest in more on the relative scale on data scientists and data analysis into the company.
And as a result of this, we are now, currently, just to give you an example of the scale of that we're doing, we're working now on 50 projects that is all relating into the things which I talked about earlier about driving down costs, increasing revenue, improve operational resiliency and improve the customer satisfaction with ourselves. And that 50 projects, that is more than double the projects of data that we had just in the last 6 months. So this is something that we're really accelerating.
Brexit, we started planning, and this is important. We started planning for the Brexit, 2 years ago. This is not something that we have started focusing on only the last couple of months. And we have plan basically for every scenario that is out there. And we are confident that easyJet will continue to fly with no disruption Post march 29 11:00 p.m. The focus that we have done spans over a number of areas, and I'll give you more detail on that now.
First, our structure and our flying rights. Both the EU and the U.K. had said that their objective is to maintain the flying rights between the EU and the U.K. even in the event of a no deal. That was something that came out from the European Commission as late as of last week on the 30 of December with the proposed measure to protect those right. And that has also been reciprocated by early statement from the U.K. government.
EasyJet Europe has been established, which is headquartered in Vienna and will enable easyJet to continue to operate flights across the EU and domestically within the EU countries after the U.K. has left the EU. The new structure means that easyJet now is a pan-European airline group, with 3 airlines based in Austria, Switzerland and also in the U.K.
And as you can see in the table here, only 35% of our capacity flies between U.K. and EU. And therefore, the majority of our network is in a solid position no matter what the outcome is.
Second, let me talk you through the operation. The specific steps we are taking to ensure our ability to operate are: ensuring that the Austrian operation has no reliance on our U.K. operation, in particular, by obtaining Austrian safety certificates where it's required, making sure that our third-party suppliers are Brexit-ready and have the required certificate, completing also our plan for spare parts to make sure that they are in the right place post-Brexit. So we don't face any risk of custom delays and we're not reliant on the U.K. certificate spare parts.
We're also ensuring that our people are protected. And this is being addressed by we're also transferring the 1,400 pilot licenses that we have today from U.K. to the EU 27. We're transferring over 3,000 cabin crew at the stations both to be completed by the Brexit date. And of course, we're also keeping a close eye on the residency requirement that might be required and supporting our people in the process if this is appropriate.
We have aircraft in the right place and we'll continue to allocate those around the network to maximize the contribution and the return, and that is already in the schedule for next year and the summer '19.
Next thing is the ownership. With regards to ownership, easyjet is well prepared with the more advantaged position than many other affected airlines and the number of options that are being considered to ensure that we remain EU owned and controlled. We begin from a position of strength, with approximately 47% of the shares already held by qualifying nationals. EasyJet's Investor Relation program has focused mainly Europe since 2016 with intention of increasing this to involve 50% prior to the U.K. exit from the EU.
In addition to easyJet's Article of Association which contain provision to allow to take action if necessary to ensure it continues to satisfy the EU ownership and control requirements. This provisions permit easyJet to regulate the level of ownership by non-qualifying nationals by suspending voting rights to attend the voted meeting for shareholders and/or forcing the sale of shares owned by non-qualifying national to qualifying nationals. A similar policy exists also in the Articles of Association of other airlines, as well in the articles of companies that works in different industry, but have similar national share ownership requirements.
Now it's true to say that it's important to say that we have no current intention of exercising these powers. The position will be kept under review pending the outcome of the Brexit negotiation between the U.K. and EU, but that is the powers that we have but its all been approved, and they are all well known. And like I said, with that 47% of the shareholder we have today, it's a very small percentage that we are talking about.
Regarding our consumer demand, we are seeing UK demand remains strong. And what you have seen from the slide and we presented earlier, the H2 bookings are actually slightly ahead of the same time last year.
Finally, we also have the significant financial strength with an investment grade credit rating and strong liquidity in the company.
So if you bring all of these things in together, you take the core of airline, you take the foundations that I talked you through, the 5 priorities that we have that we go through in detail, adding on them to also the initiatives that I talked about within holidays, within the business passengers and within loyalty, you're going to see that this is an airline who has the strength, and foundations and opportunity to capture revenue and decrease costs that I will say that I don't think you can find anyone else out there in Europe who has the same opportunities to do so.
We have clear strategy now in terms of the priorities that I talked about. We got a team in place to deliver this, not only that people are here today, but a fantastic team of individuals and the other people in the organization. This will be a year of investments. And we will make sure that we continue to invest in the things that really pays off, that really drives the profit per seat. We're going to invest a lot in data because data will be the key to continue to reduce significantly cost out of the business to drive revenue performance, improve operational efficiency and also increase customer satisfaction. We got a strong investment grade balance sheet that we are ready to use if there are opportunities to come up that we will benefit from.
And what this all means for the shareholder is clear, that we're going to maximize the return on capital employed. We're going to maintain the capital discipline we have within that company. We got to make sure that we are maximizing the profit proceed by investing in the core of airlines and initiatives that I talked about, and also generating sustainable positive cash flows into the business post-payment of dividends -- ordinary payments of dividends. And we'll do that and to the property we have, continued to invest also in the fleet to make sure we have not only great deal on the fleets, the aircraft we're getting, but also flexibility within the fleet plan.
So with that, I'm going to open up for question. Thank you very much."
A - Unidentified Company Representative,1,[Indiscernible]
Daniel Roeska,1,"Good morning. Sanford Bernstein. 3 questions, if I may. Number 1, on the strategy, Johan, could you elaborate the big ideas and the big strategies you decided against in that strategy? So what are the things you're not pursuing or sometimes the hardest thing to do when developing strategy?"
Johan Lundgren,1,Long-haul.
Daniel Roeska,1,"Really next to that. Secondly, on the costs kind of the way you phrasing you provide the guidance. You had a lot of one-off issues, though directly with the higher but the work levers and the higher disruption costs in your '18 base. You're keeping that flat into '19. Kind of seems to be fair to say there's around £100 million in there you're spending on project. That's a run rate around that level. And you're putting higher investment into the business to develop the business. Should we think about that as a step change that you'd stay and you'll continue investing more in the business? Or is that kind of a transitory period for 12, 24 months, and kind of the project costs will subside after that? And then lastly, on the different KPIs. How fast will you be able to implement that into management and team conversation? And is there any difference in the pyramid kind of between the top and the bottom in terms of KPIs where you're measuring people against?"
Johan Lundgren,1,"I'll kick off, and you can fill in about that. I mean on the costs, it's fair to say that the investments we're making, for instance, in the 3 initiatives, as in holidays, and business, they're all, they are risk-free, but we know that they are there to deliver sustainable really returns to the business. That's the same thing when you're looking at the data. Data is the key enabler for us to reduce the costs that sits within the area of today of disruption as an example. We could not continue to manually fix and trying to mitigate some of these things without using data as an example. But I think that it is with very limited risk around this, but it has quite early paybacks on these things. So the biggest cost thing we have to focus on is disruption, bar none. I mean that is the really, really the key thing. We talked her about what the increase has been in this year's numbers, and that gives you an example of the scale. 
And I think also, other airlines have talked about what the size sits in here. But I don't think that there's anyone else who actually have come out with a way on tackling this. And when I look through all the things we're doing, I think we're well on way to make a significant change on that. But having said that, look, this issue won't go away. It's not like we think in that, the congestions in the airspace and the efficiencies on how this is being used in 2019 is just suddenly going to be much improved. But we are working. And I'm engaging a lot with the European Commission on this, with the Euro Control on this matter to make sure that they actually get their act together, staff their agency wise and then start using the systems in a better way. Do you want to add something on the cost?"
Andrew Findlay,1,"On the KPIs, that's something that we work through and that has been implemented right now into everyone's targets for 2019."
Johan Lundgren,1,"And I think it's fair to say on the KPI, why is this so powerful? We've a number of shoots as a KPI before. But I think what we found out, we wanted to get more clarity around the 5 strategic priorities that I've talked about, so we can easily measure and people can feel that how they relate into what they do so we can measure the progress amongst those KPIs."
Daniel Roeska,1,Any difference in the top 4 bottom KPIs? Is there cost KPI somewhere indetermined?
Johan Lundgren,1,"Well, there is, and it goes through everything what we do. What we're doing, and we talked about the 6 KPIs that we have in here, we have broken those down as well, so it's actually relating to how people go on and do the day-to-day job."
Daniel Roeska,1,What is the cost specific on that on cost savings?
Johan Lundgren,1,Yes. 
Damian Brewer,1,"Damian Brewer from RBC. 3 again, please. First of all, just coming to the considered of the CSAT scores, the OTP they seems to have kind of dislocated, are you still got good CSAT scores despite the OTP. I think I remember Chris saying in the past that basically, the view was an easy check your front-line is your bottom line. Taking all that, you have good CSAT scores, staff that seem happy, how quickly given the fuel costs to deal with? Do you think you can improve the yield in the business, whether it's directly through fare or through ancillaries? So I appreciate everything you've given us in the detail. But how quickly does that turn into improvements? And how fast can you move on that given that the very good backdrop you've got? 
And then secondly, on cash flow, I guess these are 2 parts to it. First, you've given us the sort of minimum and maximum fleet, but a base case CapEx level. What will be the differential in the CapEx in '21 and '22 at the minimum maximum levels of fleet? And then, secondly, on the cash flow. Clearly, the last 2 years, you benefit from improvements in the fuel payments terms, improvements in credit card terms. In terms of moving the free cash flow forward in future years, what is it that drives the free cash flow better in future after those 2 what look like one-offs?"
Johan Lundgren,1,"I'll do the first 2. Andrew, you do the third one. You're right. I mean I think it's the first time that we actually see that the customer satisfaction score has actually improved despite deteriorating situation around the disruption. And I think that comes back a lot with the focus we've had on looking after our customers, which is far more that you can say competing airlines are doing, and that pays off because we know that this also drives loyalty, which is an important thing for ourselves.
There's a number of things we can do to drive revenue, and I'll show some of them in here as well. The way our yield system works. We have a great yield system. We got a great revenue system in there as well. But we got more to do in terms of actually how we can yield and trade on, for instance, ancillaries as an example. We have more things we can do that we're implementing right now also to take a more strategic view about competitive capacity that exists out in the market to make sure that our systems and our algorithm take that into consideration. Also, when it looks at competitive pricing, as an example, things that we're now feeding into our system to be able to optimize the benefits from the revenue performance. 
So I think that is standing in most of his time really looking at how we can drive these revenue benefits as well and the opportunities we have, with an already good system, is really there for us to take on to the next level. So we're looking for this to continue in and have an affect also in 2019. I think it's important to say that, as we drive forward and we do improve on the revenue per seat, that doesn't exclude anything of our attention and focus to reduce cost. It's not like we're ever being complacent about the fact that we think we can only get here by revenue enhancement opportunities and continue to build on the success. Cost will be absolutely key and disruption is the key thing to take that cost out of the business."
Andrew Findlay,1,"Just talk about the fleet plan. I think it's fair to say that even at the minimum fleet plan, we'll see seats capacity growing given that the A321 in a nut case and trajectory within this plan. So and that the range of this plan absolutely supports the range of 3% to 8% annualized fleet capacity growth that we've guided and delivered on the past on an organic basis. From a point of view of cash CapEx, well, the difference between the top and the bottom, I think it's fair to say, in the arrangement that we've reagreed with Airbus, we've have to do press release out and our flexibilities. So if you remember back in 2013 when we did the original deal, we had significant flexibility. We've effectively repressed that restart and gain significant flexibility. So the difference between the top and bottom within those 3, so within, between 20, 2020 and 2022, we can defer up to 30 aircraft if we so wish. So from the rest of it would be the difference is fundamentally things like lease returns, early lease returns or non-extension of existing leases or exit of our 3 year 319 to 16 years, So that gives you an idea of the difference between the top and the bottom based on CapEx flexibility we expect that to fill capability within period of time.
So one of your free cash, and I'm not going to give you the exact specifics around that the impacts on free cash flow, it's 30 aircraft work it's the difference in those, in that top and the bottom. But with respect to free cash, we are targeting to manage our capacity growth and our fleet investments to maximize PBT per seat, returns on capital deployed and on free cash flow, which are the 3 objectives we're absolutely focused on over the coming years. And with respect to the -- that where we see the generation of that cash, through the margin accretive initiatives that we talked about, so holiday, business and loyalty, all relatively low capital intensive opportunities, and we could effectively driving the PBT per seat to the incremental margin will help deliver that free cash flow. So fundamentally, the things around the balance sheet, as you say, payment terms and credit card deals, et cetera, have a pretty much been solidified within the cash flow is now around operational performance and driving that PBT per seat by those low capital intensive opportunities."
James Hollins,1,"So James Hollins from Exane. I have 3, please. The first one is on Tegel. I was wondering if you could let us know if you're still targeting breakeven in full year '19, and whether there's going to be more exceptionals this year, whether all sort of cost there will be in the bottom line. Secondly, I was wondering if you could give an update on your target for lease to be owned, the proportion of fleet, whether that's changed, how you think that evolves through to 2024. And then finally, you're probably about 80% sold on Q1. I was wondering if revenue per seat will be down year-on-year."
Johan Lundgren,1,"So on the Tegel, I mean, we've -- as I mentioned, we are extraordinary pleased with the way that we've managed our team to integrate to the business as well. We don't expect anything more from an exceptional point of view in there. And the prediction is we now have the #1 market place there. We are targeting, of course, to breakeven in Berlin as a whole, that hasn't changed. I think it's fair to say within the scale of this operation, that it takes some time before we get up to the average of the network profitability, but that remains our target, to be profitable for the whole of the Berlin."
Andrew Findlay,1,"With respect to -- James, with respect to lease, we moved away from having a specific target. Historically, in 2018, we moved away from that with the capital structure be back in '16, and fundamentally, it's a balance between managing resilience, managing costs and managing flexibility. The outcome of that would be your fleet mix of owned versus lease. Currently, with 30% leased has a step up as a result of the inorganic activity within Tegel. Over a period of time, that will drift downwards. But fundamentally, it's all around managing. We don't see leases or sale and leasebacks as a funding engine. It's more of resilience management and management process to exit between ‘19. Things works well. So the 2 SLB transactions we've done today, ‘20, we understand where they're going they've been secured outside Europe so we were not going to be competing against us. And that and it helps sustain the ongoing price and of A319, and have done its job. So we'll see that track down. 
With respect to Q1, I think its fair to say we were know that tough comps in Q1 so half 1 reflects the tough comes in Q1 and into Q2 plus the shift half 1 into half 2. So I think it's fair to say that we should see RPS down in line with the half 1 guidance we've given."
Johan Lundgren,1,"And just to mention on Tegel because I think in important one as well, I mean the way that the organization and the way we have integrated out in the team have been absolutely fantastic. You will see some one of our competitors who stated that clearly that a big reason why they missed some of the numbers was because of the integration of their part of this transaction. And this has been really the -- an airline besides Monarch that we've been seamlessly integrating into the operation, which gives us a great foundation to build on in the future."
Neil Glynn,1,"Hi. Neil Glynn from Crédit Suisse. So If I can ask 2 questions on revenue. The first one, with respect to 2019, the ancillary revenue per passenger -- or sorry, per seat was up 10% at constant currency in 2018, so a lot of momentum I guess you've got big plans in terms of driving that going forward. So just interested, should that 10% slow down into 2019, or how we should think about ancillaries this year? And then, more medium term, I think Johan, you mentioned, near to half of your passengers basically fly easyJet once a year. Just basically thinking, is there a way including partners, for example, that you can make easyJet a more relevant part of potential passengers day-to-day life, thinking about things like branded credit cards? Or are there other initiatives do you think could potentially make easyJet more meaningful for non-flying passengers?"
Johan Lundgren,1,"Yes. So I mean, on ancillaries, I mean we have -- continued to have to shoot pipeline of products and services that we can offer, so there is no end in terms of what we think we can do in this area. And I think also, we talked about the ability we have also to now looking at how we price and how we revenue this from an optimization point of view that gives us further additional benefits when it comes to the offers within the ancillary and what it will do to our bottom line. And in terms of partner, you're absolutely right. That is definitely one of the things we're looking at. For those customers who are not the frequent travelers, we are sure that we capture them early on to and get the engaged with established partnership with other companies, make sure that it place a bigger relevance and the reminder of them that when they do their bookings, when they think about flying, that we are first in mind of that. That is something that we're looking to do within the loyalty program."
Rishika Savjani,1,"Hi, good morning. It's Rishika from Barclays. Just one question from me on disruption actually. So I think you confide that the increase this year was £70 million or so. And the program around operational resilience. Is the intention that, that operational resilience program stabilizes the situation, such that disruption costs don't rise? Or do you think there's opportunity here to actually bring that disruption cost level back down again? And do you want to get it in there, or are you willing to quantify your total spend this year on disruption, not just the incremental?"
Johan Lundgren,1,"Yes. I mean the purpose, or ambitionis clearly to reduce this costs. I mean, but on one hand, you will see from the increase in here that the first good step would be to stabilize that. But I think it's fair to say that we have now over I think we're at 120-130 different action points in there that you can contribute substantial value to. But of course, what doesn't remain in our control is what the overall situation will be. So we have to assume that the situation won't get better. It might even get worse. But if it gets worse, we're going to make sure that we not only recover the increase of the disruption that takes place for the things that sits outside our control, but we also that we can continue to mitigate some of that from that base level point of view. And I must say we've been making great progress. Chris Browne, our CEO and Robert here our Chief Commercial Officer is working through that whole thing about how we build it, and our we execute and then we recover it. And I feel, I must say I feel very confident about our own self-help issues and initiatives here that we will have an impact. So I think we'll definitely perform better than others, and then it just remains to see how much benefit we will get out of this in 2019."
Andrew Findlay,1,"Sorry, the, what's absolute number? The question."
Johan Lundgren,1,"Yes, okay. Yes. We haven't disclosed the absolute number, but it's big."
Gerald Khoo,1,"Gerald Khoo from Liberum. You talked about your advantageous fuel hedge position. How do you go about using that? Do you take that to the bottom line? Do you use that to drive pricing to squeeze competitors? What's your thoughts there? Secondly, on the fleet change, starting to get my head around it. Is it fair to say that's, in net terms, a move to the right in terms of the delivery profile? And finally, and sorry, for the context of the IT write-off, you talked a lot about the investments in data and systems. How do you strike the balance between developing in-house and/or waiting to see if an external solution emerges?"
Johan Lundgren,1,"I'll do the first one. I mean, on the fuel hedging, I mean, it's very clear, what it allows us to do, it gets us uncertainty over the costs. And this is one of the great things that it decreases the volatility that exist in there. Of course, we want to maximize revenue as much as we can to make sure that we get as much as we can on the bottom line in there. But it's also important to maintain a really competitive pricing policy to make sure that we can capture the growth in the market. I think we've seen in 2018 a number of airlines who have been exposed to this who hasn't have ability to hedge how that hits weaker models. 
It is brutal if you're running an inefficient operation with an unsustainable business model that it doesn't take a lot, and that represents an opportunity for us to get more passengers in there. So we will always be mindful to make sure that we have the right pricing, so we can continue to achieve growth. But at the same time, also drive revenues through initiatives that we talked about here today. So it's a mix about where we want to go. But definitely, we want to capture as much as possible on that."
Andrew Findlay,1,"Yes. With the fleet, I think it's fair to say that the 18 deferred to is more of an adjustment around that the fleet profile and that fits our PBT per seat in growth aspirations. But I think it's fair to say, if you look at the graph, we've got significant growth coming through '19 and '20. And if you remember, we've got up later on top of those numbers as well. So I think it's fair to say we've got plenty of scope to grow between the 3% to 8%, as we've previously stated, and in line with what we've done previously. So I think all of this has been around triangulating those 3 things. And about data system? So I think it's fair to say on the IT platforms that we'll use for data, it will be on shelf and will be well developed off-the-shelf systems. 
For example, Hadoop which we're currently using and leveraging, and I think that the vast investment data around capability, and as Johan said, that we've got now and the team, we're building out that capability. We've got billions of points of data that we are using to the extent that we could be. And with IT perspective, it's all about really integrating the existing systems into the off-the-shelf platform. These teams can then go and analyze and use to monetize, which is exactly what we want to do. So it's a very different proposition from an IT perspective to what we did from a point of view of the SAP platform."
Mark Simpson,1,"It's Mark Simpson from Goodbody. I have 3 questions. One for Andrew. Just on capacity guidance, the implication is that the second half, we'll see 6% growth. Can you break that down, as you did for the first half between organic, upgauging, Tegel? On the easyJet holidays, I don't know if there's any consideration about buying post hotel inventory to package up the right product. But if not, in a sense, how do you engage with hotels to be a partner to encourage or say the right product to your customer? 
And then thirdly, it's probably a timing issue. But if you look at your 23 aircraft at Tegel, 665 pilots and cabin crew, ratio 29 to plane, your last reference point at the end of last year was actually a ratio of 39 personnel per plane. So I'm wondering to ask, either are you doing something very clever in Tegel, or is that just a mismatch of those 2 data point?"
Andrew Findlay,1,"I'll take the first one. So I think it's fair to say that there's an element of annualization from Tegel into the summer because, obviously, we would have had a lower capacity growth as a result of using the A1 460s which obviously lower gauge, and we've not got 320s in place, there will be significant uplift there. And you have some annualization from the activities we're doing in Manchester as we talked about. And the rest really is around focusing on building number 1 and number 2 positions. So for example, in winter, we've got incremental aircraft in Belfast, Bristol, Gatwick, Manchester, Basel, Nice, Malpensa. 
We've got some in Venice. Some of these adapts around our existing network and building those positions and building the routes of those positions. So I think fundamentally, it's leveraging our exposure in those places. And as I said, we've got 7, as Johan said, we've got 7 incremental number 1 positions in fy '18, and clearly, we want to solidify those and built from those."
Johan Lundgren,1,"I don't, on the holidays, it's not plan to buy any hotel inventory because we simply don't need to. If you think about it, and this is really important and part of the attraction of the holidays piece in here that a number of the competitors that are buying hotel inventory, who owns actually their stock in the day also highly inefficient airlines. We have cost advantages here of 35% towards them. 
So actually, with the cost base that we have and with the frequencies how we can fly, I mean, we fly many times of the day, all days of the week to some of the destinations, where others, on a 35% higher cost base would fly 3, 4 days a week. We actually would like to go in to where other competitors are because that's where we can expose really the value of what we're going to be able to contribute out the whole chain. So if we down the road would have exclusivities in something that will be a national evolvement of where we stand today, but actually, the opportunity for us comes within the fact that we can be on -- in the hotels that is in the most demand, that is most loved one. But we also see -- and we've had a lot of hoteliers being actually already offering us so-called differentiated hotel products, product that have specific, it cater to specific needs when it comes to the food and beverage, when it comes to the entertainment, when it comes to the facility. And that's because they can see the value that we will bring into them in terms of the brand, the unique 350 million web visitors we have every year, and also with the frequencies and the scale that we have into the operations. So from us, it would be better actually be to go in where everybody else because that's where we can demonstrate this value better than anything else. 
Sorry, what was the third questions?"
Mark Simpson,1,[Indiscernible] 
Johan Lundgren,1,"I cannot answer that. Robert? Sorry, timing difference from."
Robert Carey,1,The 320 aircraft that we operate will be identically as we do our core fleet.
Andrew Lobbenberg,1,"It's Andrew Lobbenberg from HSBC. You've given us your KPI, in particular you ended the presentation with a focus on the shareholder oriented KPIs. Are there going to be targets at any stage? And I guess, very specifically, you speak of sustainable cash flows. It's earning commitment, do positive cash flows on any specific time horizon? And then can I ask about M&A? How do you see the industry developing broadly? Do we expect more consolidation? Or do you think the recent pullback in the fuel price means that the Darwinism is over for now? And I guess in that context specifically, were you publicly involved in Alitalia? I guess curious to see what happens there. Thanks."
Johan Lundgren,1,"I'll do first and the third. We haven't set out targets. We do believe that there's quite a lot of uncertainty out there into the markets, but we -- what we have done and what we will continue to do is to demonstrate the opportunities that we've had and clarified what was in the plans, talked about the initiatives and also the investments in our back end, increase revenue and drive down costs and what the impact that it will have. But at the moment, we don't feel that there is a need to go out with specific targets on that. 
And I can just refer to the third question as well on the M&A. I mean consolidation will continue to happen, both organically and also through transactions. It's quite interesting when you're looking at the consolidation of the whole of the aviation, there was about 25 airlines in 2005 that accounted for some 84% of European aviation. That number in 2015 was 11 airlines. Now so this is something that has happened over a period of time. And I think it is partly because inefficient legacy models are basically year by year growing out of fashion. It can't compete with the companies such as ourselves and also others for that matter. We have the balance sheet. We got the financial strength to take and participate in opportunities if transactions are available, as we did with Air Berlin. That's a good example. But like I said earlier and I've said on previous indications, there are 3 things that need to be happen for us to get be interested. One, it needs to be -- strategically, it needs to make sense. And of course, we are focused on short-haul, we are focused on Europe. It needs to be commercial terms here that we would find attractive to ourselves. And we also need to have the capability to handle any transaction. And once we get just to reiterate that the enormous achievement that I think that we're seeing with Air Berlin this year as an example. But you're right, opportunities will come. And they -- we have done a very thorough job to look at each and every one of the European airlines and working out what everyone's position is and also thinking where everybody's going. And based on that, we have tremendous strength, and we will continue to participate in strategic opportunities if they arise."
Andrew Findlay,1,"Just to add that point, you mentioned Darwinism does not mean that is strongest -- stronger and yes, there is an element of that and we always said that. And you will expect that. With respect to cash flows, can give a specific date, we have existing significant investments in the next couple of years with respect to the fleet. As I said to Damien's question, our cash flows is all driven by delivery of a number of our focus areas, which includes the initiatives in the margin accretive initiatives that will drive profit per seat, and that will help us to see the position of a free cash flow after dividend. And we've got a clear plan that we've into our peers and as a board we got in place within the horizon to we plan today. So next couple of years, we'll see some investment. And then as we deliver on some of the initiatives that we talked about and we deliver the extra margin, we'll see that cash flow coming through."
Penny Butcher,1,"Penny Butcher from Morgan Stanley. I'm going to try and outstand your question in a slightly different way on the management goals which regard to the Brexit and PBT. I appreciate you don't want to set timings or formal numbers, but could you at least say whether some of the goals you did have in the past on those metrics, sort of the 15%, 20% ROCE, the £10 per PBT per seat, are they kind of the numbers that would seem fair even if you don't want to set a time horizon for achieving them? And then just one question, on the financial outline, and I think it's Slide 8, Andrew, while you kind of walked through the headline cost per seat. That doesn't seem to quite correlate with the table you have in the appendix as to the drivers by the different line items. So is it possible that you could just talk about what's in the other components of that Slide 8 factor? Because in the appendix, that seems to refer to increase in disruption costs, but you've called that out separately. So what's actually in the other in the first table? That would be helpful."
Johan Lundgren,1,"Sure. I mean, on the first one you said,look the plan that we have introduced within the company and then we set out in the focus, that is all there to improve the ROCE. It's all there to improve the PBT per seat. It is all there to make sure that we continue to do more when it comes to the cash flows and the positive cash flow that we want to deliver on a sustainable basis, that's all there to do. It isn't an ambitious plan we have internally with a lot of self-help initiatives. We're not relying on external factors to make that happen, but we are keeping those targets and the process internally for the time being because there are uncertainty out in the market but we would like to prove every number you will have seen from the 2018 results."
Andrew Findlay,1,"Yes, okay. With respect to the reconciliation. So in this table across here, you've got it by driver and the table here is by P&L line, so you will have effectively impact your cost program savings will have impacted the lines in the accounting. So therefore, having seen kind of a reduction on costs where the table on Page 8, we've got an increase, so you can show the that focus are cost saving initiatives around flexing our growth. In other inflation, we've got effectively other central cause of inflation, plus ground handling. We have invested some moneys in DHL, which we've talked about before. 
And effectively, that's driving incremental returns for us, and we will look to invest in improving our ground handling opportunities elsewhere to improve that on-time performance and have a marked change the day we put DHL in Gatwick it had a huge impact on our performance. And what it's done is also help reduce our disruption cost, even though there's been a significant uplift in those costs, but that's fundamentally the 2 key points."
Kathryn Leonard,1,"Kathryn Leonard from Numis Securities. Just 3 for me if that's okay, please. Just thinking about the forward bookings for the second half of this year and just slightly ahead. Just wonder whether that's required on a yield stimulation at all? And whether you've seen any changes in the trajectory as through the course of the Brexit negotiation and the big headlines. 
Secondly, just on the holidays piece, just thinking about how you create that value for the customer more against, rather than the 2 reasons on the scripts as well but the here OTA peers that you have and whether it'd be booking.com, Expedia or the UK markets and smaller peers, how do you differentiate yourselves? And how does that come in to ultimately discounting? And does that impact how we think about the meaningful contribution to profit? And how should we think about that? 
And then the third question, just on the aircraft being in the right place and Brexit. And you've given the various figures on which markets those are in. Looking at that, I mean that suggests that 7, 54% to 0 aircraft are currently in the UK market, which is somewhat ahead of the 35% of capacity. So just wondering whether there will be any shifts around with that as you get closer to any hard potential Brexit."
Johan Lundgren,1,"So I'll start randomly on these 3 questions and then Andrew can fill the gap on that as well. I mean we haven't done anything to incentivize or stimulate the numbers for the H2. I mean that's pretty much in line what we would always do. But it's quite encouraging to see that despite all the noise in the media about Brexit and perhaps the other things as well, that there is a demand out across in the bookings that we're seeing. On the holidays piece, it's important because I think it's a good question because, on one hand, you have the competitors that is kind of the old legacy tour operator models, and that's why I did explain about where I believe we have some fantastic opportunity to provide additional value when it comes to what we can offer from the airline point of view as well. 
Now the question is then to say how do you so that is something that I feel very confident that we can compete very successfully on. When it then comes to the OTAs and the booking.com, you've got to remember that those players exceed their bookings as well. They are mostly technology platforms. I mean booking.com has something like 1.3, 1.4 million hotels out there. We don't need 1.3 million hotels there. We need to get a which we established relationship with some of the most loved in the non-hotel that exists on the network that we fly on to. And by giving them also the opportunity to our distribution, those 350 million unique visitors that we have per year, the 90 million customers that travel with us every year, we can make sure that we provide them with much more volume than if we were to spread this out across like, in their case, in booking.com, 1.3 million. So I think we are in extraordinarily good position to compete with everyone in this space."
Andrew Findlay,1,Remakes?
Johan Lundgren,1,"Right, yes."
Andrew Findlay,1,"So I think and all there are going to recognize in there includes our flight between UK and Switzerland, so that won't be impacted by you've got all the UK domestic flying. And also, you've got the EU27 27. So the combination of the number of things in there we do on all the work plan Europe 117 aircraft are still underway to go to get to the target position before March. But it's not much more than, it's about 113 we get to the right balance basically the schedule that we got in the mix to fly between the jurisdictions that we've got, so we're in good shape."
Johan Lundgren,1,"Coffee. Listen, thank you all very much for coming as well. I hope you're excited as we are. We've had a fantastic year for 2018 as well, and the foundations we have to build upon is quite extraordinary. So thank you very much for that."
