Operator,0,"Good morning and welcome to Taylor Morrison’s Conference Call. Currently all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to introduce Mr. Jason Lenderman, Vice President and Investor Relations and Treasury."
Jason Lenderman,0,"Thank you and welcome, everyone, to Taylor Morrison's conference call to discuss our proposed acquisition of AV Homes. With me today are Sheryl Palmer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dave Cone, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Before I turn the call over to Sheryl, let me remind you that today's call, including the question-and-answer session, includes forward-looking statements that are subject to the Safe Harbor statement for forward-looking information that you will find in today's news release. These statements reflect the current views of Taylor Morrison management and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And we do not undertake any obligation to update our forward-looking statements.
Now let me turn the call over to Sheryl Palmer."
Sheryl Palmer,0,"Thank you, Jason and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining today as we discuss the definitive merger agreement signed yesterday to acquire AV Homes. I’m delighted to talk about this opportunity in more detail and excited about bringing this business, its assets and of course their experienced team members into Taylor Morrison.
As outlined in our press release this morning, the purchase price for AV Homes is approximately $490 million which results in an attractive 1.1 price to book multiple. The transaction will be funded by approximately 60% cash and 40% in Taylor Morrison’s stock.
On a pro forma basis, the combined company is expected to generate more than $5 billion in revenues in 2018. We’ve consistently used our earnings announcement and conference call such as this to share our optimism and confidence in the housing cycle, reiterate the momentum in the industry and discuss the opportunities of a general under supply in our markets along with the advantages of adding debt to our current footprint.
This transaction which is subject to customary closing conditions will serve as a means to strengthen our land pipeline in the right locations, potentially offsetting some future land purchases while simultaneously delivering land to our home building operations with mature communities.
This proposed purchase is driven by our respect for the AV business and its’ leadership. It allows us to accelerate our growth with their attracted synergistic land portfolio and complimentary product offering and achieve real SG&A leverage for the business.
The increased local scale will allow for more install [ph] in for trade, greater adherence to our strict construction cadence and amplifies our purchasing power. As discussed on our February call, we began 2018 by laying out our strategic priorities for the year with our team members, those being strategic growth, operational excellence and a differentiated customer experience. We believe this acquisition fully supports our strategic growth priority by bringing us deeper into five of our current markets, adding Jacksonville to the portfolio, and further expanding our offerings in the affordable 55 plus and first-time buyer customer segments.
AV’s average sales price for 2018 is expected to be in the low to mid-300 while Taylor Morrison’s is expected to be slightly higher than last year in the 470 [ph] representing a clear opportunity to broader our more affordable offering.
As we compared our footprint to theirs, it became clear that by moving forward with this transaction we’d be able to bolster our opposition by increasing our market share in each of these high performing markets with expected long term favorable fundamentals.
For example in Charlotte, we will move from outside of the top ten and in Raleigh just inside of the top ten to both being firmly in the top five. Almost immediately following entry into Charlotte and Raleigh in 2015 in connection with the Orleans acquisition, we were clear in our intent to grow our presence in those markets and feel this purchase allows us to accelerate those plans.
In Orlando, last year we would have moved from a builder outside of the top five to the number two builder in the market. Similarly for Phoenix, one of our strongest businesses in the portfolio this deal would have solidified our place as number three by volume. And in Dallas looking forward, we would expect to increase our position and complement the Darling and Taylor Morrison offerings moving us to inside the top five.
From a product offering standpoint, we are excited at the possibility of folding AV’s lineup into Taylor Morrison suite of offerings. Currently, AV operates within the entry level, first move up and active adult consumer groups all segments that are squarely in Taylor Morrison’s real path [ph].
But as I mentioned earlier, they really like the emphasis and expansion into the more affordable first-time buyer market. This transaction will allow us to grow this segment in a strategic way that keeps in what we define as path of growth locations, very similar to our JEH and Acadia acquisitions in the Atlanta market in 2015.
Equally exciting as we look towards the future and our plans to grow our active lifestyle communities and offerings is AV’s existing active adult product in Orlando, Raleigh and Phoenix. Their present mirrors some of our active lifestyle communities within those markets but it’s positioned at the more affordable price points. In fact there are 55 plus land represents over 50% of their overall portfolio. This includes their award-winning 4000 acre community, Solivita that is well known in the Central Florida region for offering their buyers the perfect balance of outdoor living, comfort and luxury.
This extremely successful community is being followed by a sister community of approximately 2800 acres Solivita Grande [ph] that we expect will generate similar results. We believe these commonalities in product offerings and consumer groups will create opportunities for scale efficiencies and enhance our national footprint while creating top and bottom line performance improvement.
This transaction will increase our lot count by approximately 17,000 lots and our years of supply from the four year range to the five year range, based on a trailing 12-months of the combined business, well within where we believe the company should be positioned.
On an outlet basis, we’ll be adding roughly 70 active selling communities to our business, and like our last four acquisitions we’ll access the timing of when it makes sense to fully convert all existing AV family branded communities to the Taylor Morrison brand.
Another area in which we see benefit from the transaction is leveraging our financial services platform. Taylor Morrison Home funding, a leader in the industry is licensed and operating in each of AV’s market and we intend to offer [Indiscernible] services across the acquired platform replacing AV’s recently formed financing joint venture.
We also have our title operations, inspired title services, operating in Florida, North Carolina and Texas, which will provide additional benefits and products for both the customer and sales team to match the experience and success of our Taylor Morrison business.
Before turning the call over to Dave to discuss more of the transaction details, let me wrap up my opening comments by reiterating how enthusiastic I am about the opportunities this acquisition provides to Taylor Morrison and our customers, team members and trade partners.
We’ve made it a priority to grow in a smart and meaningful way this year and this is a great first step in that direction.
So with that Dave, I’ll turn it over to you."
Dave Cone,0,"Thanks, Sheryl, and hello, everyone. As Sheryl mentioned in her remarks, the purchase price is $490 million, which will be funded by approximately 60% in cash and 40% in Taylor Morrison stock.
We’d also assume the debt on AV’s balance sheet including $80 million in convertible debt, but excluding any amount under AV’s existing revolving credit facility. Assuming all holders of the convertible debt elect to convert their notes in connection with the transaction, there will be a resulting payment of approximately $95 million in additional consideration, which is subject to being sold in cash or stock in accordance with the terms of those notes.
We believe our story, strategy, vision and ability to deliver results for our shareholders makes our stock a strong value proposition for AV’s shareholders. I’d also note that TPG as the largest AV shareholder has elected to receive 100% of their payment in the form of Taylor Morrison stock subject to proration.
Our current strategy for the cash portion of the purchase price is the use a mix of cash on hand approximately $180 million, along with potential funds raised through an opportunistic senior note offering, in order to increase our optimality as to when we access the debt markets while also maintaining a prudent cash balance for operations.
We have secured a $200 million commitment for a 364 day short-term revolver. The equity portion will be funded by a fixed exchange ratio of Taylor Morrison stock for every share of AV home stock. We believe our balance sheet is strong and we have ample liquidity to support this acquisition.
Lastly, we will seek to expand our current $500 million revolving credit facility to $600 million.
We believe both the debt issuance and increased revolver capacity will give us ongoing working capital to fund our combined larger operations while taking advantage of the still favorable interest rates.
This transaction will increase our net debt to cap ratio, but it will remain very healthy and somewhere in the low 40% range. Our preliminary estimate for goodwill is about $70 million, representing 14% of the purchase price. Once we complete the integration, we believe we will drive annual synergies of 30 million and 2019 EPS will be accretive. This transaction serves one of our three priorities for the year and it also fits within our capital allocation philosophy. The first two tenants within the philosophy involved growth, one of which being growth through M&A.
This speaks to our commitment to staying true to our convictions and true to the structure we have when placing capital. The third tenant within that philosophy is maintaining a strong balance sheet which we believe this does. The fourth tenant is returning cash to shareholders through our share buybacks. Since we may be reducing land spend in some of the overlapping divisions, this fourth tenant is still on the table for us to pursue this year.
As we’ve mentioned numerous times before, our goal is to drive accretive returns for shareholders and this transaction along with these other capital allocation strategies will do that. We have not purchased any of our stock during the second quarter due to the ongoing discussions with AV. With the transaction pending, we will not be permitted to repurchase stock until after some period post close. The acquisition of AV will not impact our ability to acquire stock in the future as we believe we will generate sufficient cash flow.
As a reminder, we have approximately 96 million remaining on the share repurchase authorization through December 31, 2018. Given that the transaction was just fine last evening, we are not in a position to comment on how we’d adjust our guidance based on the combined company, but we do reaffirm the second quarter guidance we provided during our first quarter call.
For the months of April and May, we had an absorption pace of about 2.7. This is tracking better than our internal expectations. Thanks, and I’ll now turn the call back over to Cheryl."
Sheryl Palmer,0,"Thank you, Dave. We are excited about this acquisition and what it will do for our business moving forward. Strengthening our land pipeline and providing resources that will build on our momentum for the short and long-term will enhance our overall positioning of the developer and builder in markets that are expected to outperform this year and beyond.
With an expectation to close in late Q3 or early Q4, we know there is much work to be done. I do want to thank Roger Craig, the rest of the AV leadership team and the Taylor Morrison team led by Lou Steffens, our President of M&A. They have all put in many hours and done great work to get us to this point, and I do look forward to welcoming the rest of the AV Homes organizations later this year.
With that, I’d like to open the call to questions. Operator, please provide our participants with instructions."
Operator,1,"Thank you, Ma'am. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Your line is now open."
Alan Ratner,1,"Hey guys, good morning congrats on the deal."
Sheryl Palmer,1,Hey.
Alan Ratner,1,"So I guess the question I’m sure, you are going to be getting is lying now. I think that AV obviously it seems like that there might have been some opportunities to pursue a deal at various points in this cycle. You know with the stocks obviously performing the way they have recently, there’s investor concern over the duration of the cycle, it sounds like your comments certainly, you’re not seeing that in your business and you sound pretty bullish, but why at this stage with rates moving up and investor fears obviously elevated why you think that’s the right time to do this deal?"
Sheryl Palmer,1,"Thanks. Alan, I appreciate the question. You know I think we’ve shared our optimism in the cycle and the opportunities that we believe it had. I think a lot of the bearishness we hear really is about looking in the rearview mirror and understanding by prior cycle, looks like this cycle is not performing anything like it. The environment is very healthy, consumers are feeling really good about their jobs, and we’re just starting to see wage growth. We’re in a remarkably undersupplied environment, forget if you’re talking, just talking about shelter Alan you know believe these markets that are part of this transaction, has very strong underlying fundamentals. They are expected to have long-term strength. AV has a very attractive land position that further supports our strategy that we've been talking about for quite some time around 55 plus in the first-time buyer group. We talk a lot about the barbell and our emphasis on that first-time buyer and with the millennials a kind of third, a third and a third being the middle part of their market being that first times move out.
We've also talked a lot about this smaller part of our first-time buyer, is that more affordable price point. So we like this as our positions don't cannibalize our communities. We think rather to natural extension I mean it gives us real depth in this consumer group. We've spend a lot of time underwriting this transaction. We saw all of the assets. We're familiar with all of the markets. We're familiar with the product.
Lastly I'd say, and probably most importantly the enhanced concentrated scale really allows us to improve our execution for both brands, while garnering the synergies from the overheads giving us the purchasing power of the combined business. So, I know there's a lot of – you know, there's a lot of new headlines out there every day, but we have great confidence and I guess I would wrap up with saying even more so, I have great confidence in our team. We've done four other deals. We're excited to welcome this quality team from AV into our organization. And I keep saying lastly, but lastly, it's attractive when one book multiple. It's next to impossible today to get that kind of concentration of good assets that one want, so very bullish."
Alan Ratner,1,"Got it. Thank you very much Sheryl for that. And then Dave, just on the gross margin, I know you the synergies, I'd imagine a lot of SG&A. I think AV's guidance for margin was about 18% on a GAAP basis which is a little bit below where you were running, but I know that's going to get shuffled around with the purchase accounting. So, is the expectation that the margins will come in pretty similar to kind of what your existing businesses running at?"
Dave Cone,1,"Yes. I guess I'll speak more on a go forward basis, Alan. Obviously, we'll have to work through some of that purchase accounting as you've mentioned, but Sheryl highlighted the benefits of scale that we're going to see from the transaction which is a key reason why we pursue this. We do expect to see some national and regional purchasing rebates just kind of off the top. And we've done a fair amount of work, but still have work to do at the local level. We do anticipate soft and hard costs throughout the construction process from access to trades, to the production cadence. And in fact some of the market positions that we're acquiring here are actually larger than our legacy position. So we expect to get gains on both sides. But really to answer your question we think we're going to get these margins to comparable levels from that we're at, and that we're going to be able to drive some margin accretion year-over-year based on what we know now."
Sheryl Palmer,1,"And then when I neglected to answer your question about interest rates when you talk about timing. And hopefully you recall from our last many quarters, the amount of room that we see out with the consumer today that kind of lies on the face of what everyone says about, we're still talking at 5% interest rate. And even our most affordable FHA buyers still have 300 basis points of room within their ability to buy their houses during their contract to ourself.
So, I know there's a lot of noise on interest rates, but once again the consumers really not looking at quite that way, certainly the millennial's are looking at payment much more than they are at interest rates."
Alan Ratner,1,Got it. All right guys. Thanks again. Good luck.
Sheryl Palmer,1,Thank you.
Operator,1,Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Stephen East of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Stephen East,1,"Thank you and congratulations Sheryl and Dave. I guess I'll start with the synergy part about 30 million or so implies about 300 basis points for the AVHI. Brings it still below where you are. Are there any levers that you're not really including in your synergy right now? And I guess I'm thinking more about where their product is as far as the way it's built, the price -- the cost of it et cetera. Are there any ways that you all aren't really embedding changing product? Or is your thought process will stay with the product and go from there?"
Sheryl Palmer,1,"You know, Fair question. That is going to be an asset-by-asset decisions; Stephen. So, yes, I think there are places that you know hopefully we'll borrow their product. Certainly there will be places that we're going to change product and certainly as you know the repetition of product within our markets where that make sense we'll be doing that. We'll be value engineering the product. You know, are there opportunities on the product side? Absolutely. We are sharing a number that we're confident with and would expect as we get into the communities and we really have the ability to do side-by-side comparisons, line-by-line comparisons with trade contractors that we should see greater local synergies.
We've already built in to national synergies that are just easy day one. But the real work starts from here. And I think Dave and I would be disappointed if we don't see that number just go up."
Stephen East,1,"Got you. Okay. And then switching gears just quickly, could you give us what the mix will look like between active adult move-up in entry-level after the deal? And then you talked about with their land bank you probably will be spending less on land and development. So any type of magnitude you can frame for us?"
Sheryl Palmer,1,"Yes. So right now, Stephen you know, we're third, a third and a third. I think you're going to see both corners of the – both ends of the barbells go up. We're going to literally make sure that we qualify there – they qualify their community the way we do. Our third talk about the 50 plus and their 55 plus of their overall business as you know is the active adult. So I think you're going to see both – you're going to see the first, second time move-up shrink a little bit and you're going to see both ends go up.
I think the exciting piece as I mentioned in my prepared comments is when we talked about that first-time buyer, I generally break that up into pieces and the smallest piece of that bucket for us is that most affordable first-time buyer are tends to be more the dual income, well jobs [Indiscernible] and so this is really going to complement it. But I would expect that you're going to see that much closer to high 30s, low 40s and you'll see the same at the other end."
Stephen East,1,Okay.
Sheryl Palmer,1,"As far as the land development or the land budget, we're going to look at the opportunities of what they have in their pipeline to see how that makes sense. First, we're going to have to make the decisions around how we deploy the existing assets and then where the GAAPS still6 are, but as Dave mentioned in his comments we would expect that they seem reallocation of our spend over the coming years."
Stephen East,1,All right. Thank you.
Sheryl Palmer,1,Thank you.
Operator,1,Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.
Michael Rehaut,1,"Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First, on the – I was just hoping to get a little bit more clarity and I would say congrats on the transaction. Little bit more clarity in terms of the breakdown of the 30 million of synergies and what that you know if you kind of have buckets across perhaps expected purchase synergies or overhead? And Dave you kind of mentioned potential from in terms of construction or soft costs, which maybe little harder to put a finger on. So kind of what does that number include and not include?"
Dave Cone,1,"Yes. Thanks Mike. I guess, I'll take the 30 million and do it more at a high level. I think you're going to see more at the division and kind of corporate overhead roughly half that number. And then the rest of that is going to be made up of some of the rebates we're expecting, as well as the benefits from our mortgage business, and Sheryl had highlighted some of that on her prepared remarks and then little bit towards insurance as well. We haven't built in a lot of the local construction efficiencies yet, still in early days for us. We'll continue to do work and refine that number and something that we'll be able to provide at later date."
Michael Rehaut,1,"That makes sense. And clearly the 30 is kind of much more tangible and realizable and construction should definitely come down the road. Secondly, on lot position, you kind of mentioned that the year supply increases a bit. Could you just kind of remind us perhaps with this acquisition and obviously it might be hard to provide any type of guidance in terms of maybe working off some of AV's land imposition and your active adult just kind of different animal to a degree. But how would you expect over the next two or three years where that target might be in terms of year supply again particularly given some of the heightened concerns right now around the cycle, certainly your bullishness is noted, but does that still – it’s little bit of elevated lot position as a result of this? How would you try and approach that over the next couple years?"
Sheryl Palmer,1,"Yes. Fair question, Mike. I guess I'd make a couple of comments. One, the devil is always in the detail, right. Their lot position vary actually aligns to ours in overall strategies. So when you look at their years of supply in the most of their markets its very similar to ours, where they tend to be longer is exactly where we are and that would be your longer active adult communities.
I mentioned on the call, Solivita, that's a place where a significant amount of that land hedged [ph] and that land has been owned for decade. But when I can sit on that kind of land, on that kind of basis, I'm ecstatic. So they are longest land suppliers in Florida. And then I would tell you everything else is very similar when you look at years of supply. So what is that mean to us? I think you're going to see us travel around these five years as we have for little bit now. I think you're going to see us going through some of that pretty quickly as we can deploy the Taylor Morrison brand and as we can look at synergizing some of the marketing efforts just I think increase traffic we're going to bring into the communities by changing websites. I mean, there is all kind of opportunities, so, I kind that [Indiscernible] the kind of where we hang for up."
Dave Cone,1,"And I would just add Mike also that, I think you've seen us over the last several quarters the penetration are little bit higher to the controlled side, so we remain bullish on the cycle, but we're also trying to be prudent as we manage those investments."
Michael Rehaut,1,"And just to follow-up I guess on that thought. Certainly you've managed some of your longer positions in areas like Phoenix and Florida. Opportunistically you've been able to adjust. At the same time giving some of the longer positions of AV that you just mentioned, is there any thought around just kind of from the perspective of the sun's out make some hay a little bit over the next two or three years to bring in other partners or to monetize some of those assets from a cash flow perspective or kind of accelerating any type of -- monetizing those assets through any type of strategic actions? Or is this going to be more of steady as she goes type of playing it out as some of those lot positions may have originally been intended?"
Sheryl Palmer,1,"I think every thing is on the table, Michael. Once again when you dig into the detail and you look at the three or four communities that have the longest kind of land pipeline on the active adult side. I think we have to go into a full review and say other additional penetration would be the first place I'd start. And after penetration, I think for example I could see in one of their long, long supply communities in Florida you might take a future phase and look at family as well as active adult. So I think we're going to look at the penetrations first that could be addressed, that could be true selling lot and more to come on that."
Michael Rehaut,1,Great. Thanks so much.
Sheryl Palmer,1,Thank you.
Operator,1,Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Your lines now open.
Carl Reichardt,1,"Thanks. Good morning, guys."
Sheryl Palmer,1,Good morning.
Carl Reichardt,1,"I'm curious about the active adult business, I know there's been a bit of debate in the industry regarding the old sort of cruise ship, large community, lots of amenities versus the smaller closer in active adult communities more targeted more suburban. I'm interested in how AV's strategies evolved overtime? How years has and how you see that strategy changing if at all going forward?"
Sheryl Palmer,1,"That's a really good question. I would – I'll just share a couple of things with you. As far as the old cruise ship strategy, I think a lot of your cruise ship strategy the flaws weren't necessarily in the size of the community. The flaw on that strategy with the upfront capital required because of the locations of those communities to bring them to market and telling, you're asking people to drive 45 miles out and kind of creating a market you have to create a city.
That certainly would have been the Solivita strategy which is the largest position within the AV portfolio. But that works been done for the last 20 years. So we're the beneficiary of that great strategy. I think there's actually as we see in our active adult business and as I've said a couple times, it's a third of our portfolio and a very successful third both still survive. Location matters, but we have everything from large what you might've called cruise ship, but I would tell you structured very different than the old cruise ship.
Luxury Country Club communities to a much more affordable to a very small suburban where we're really relying on the local amenities. And with the 80 plus million boomers out there, there's plenty to go around. And so I think it really comes down to the market penetration. I went default to one strategy is better than the other. It's very market-driven, where those consumers are coming from and what they're looking for. But that's why we're enjoying this 50 plus space so well, because it's such a diversified space."
Carl Reichardt,1,"That makes lot of sense. And then on the other side of the coin, can we talk a little about AV spec strategy? What their focus has been there? And whether or not that alters how you might think about approaching the entry-level business? Thanks Sheryl."
Sheryl Palmer,1,"Now it's another great question. Given that price point and not as much – not as many includes features that tends to be a higher spec business. Very similar I would tell you from something like our Atlanta business where you're taking people potentially out of apartment. And so you need to have that inventory on the ground. I think the key to any good spec strategy is making sure it's the right house on the right lot and it's appropriately amenitized or spec to the consumer so they can come right in and you don't overdo it. They've done a really nice job there. We'll continue to revisit that, but I think that is part of the game plan when you're dealing with that first-time buyer, a little different on the active adult, but still a much higher spec business."
Dave Cone,1,"I think you'll see us follow our similar playbook, but every community might have a slightly different strategy. The Sheryl point depending on the customer segmentation, price point, the anticipated volume, we target four to five per community, but in reality it's not four to five in every community. So some could be more, some can be less. So for us we're moving forward. It's going to be on an asset-by-asset view, but its like Sheryl said around our playbook what we need to put into the spec is critical, but our primary focus is making sure we sell them before our construction is complete or shortly thereafter."
Sheryl Palmer,1,And that we're really smart especially given their active adult on the timing of those specs entering into a real season.
Carl Reichardt,1,Thanks so much.
Sheryl Palmer,1,Thank you.
Operator,1,Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Matt Bouley with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Matt Bouley,1,"Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to ask a question about the sales pace strategy, obviously AV was up close around 3.5 and clearly operating at a different price point. So could you elaborate a little bit on what if anything you would plan to change around the sales pace versus price strategy on the AV's product and I guess land going forward particularly as you rebrand?"
Sheryl Palmer,1,"Yes. I think you should expect that we will accelerate their sales space. And as I said in a couple of questions ago, I think the whole pace and price is really going to come down to an asset-by-asset review and opportunity to bring new penetrations within their communities. I don't think that it will change our strategy. We have different paces. We have communities across the portfolio that do five and six a month and we have communities that do one to two. That actually exist in theirs, but given their lower price point they tend to have a much higher pace, which is great. If anything I would hope that we can exploit that with additional marketing kind of energies in the portfolio."
Matt Bouley,1,Okay. That's helpful. Thank you for that. Second question just on the integration to the extent you can comment on it at this point. How are you thinking about integration at a management level? And then even down to kind of a local division president type of level particular in the markets where you have significant overlap? Thank you.
Sheryl Palmer,1,"Thank you. Very important question. This is our first deal since going public. So the plan will be consistent with our M&A playbook and we'll actually rely on this one with some outside resources to show that we've contemplated all the possibilities. But these are important markets and since we know them so well we have a good team within Taylor Morrison, and they have a really good team. And so, that’s a great starting place.
We’re going to actually stand up an IMO with a dedicated team, we are not going to be penny wise, pound foolish, and I have great confidence in both our teams. And as you know, any integration is made or broken on the success of how you handle the people part of it.
When I look back to all of our integration, that’s where we put a great deal of care, and that’s where I have the greatest confidence that I think is an organization, we do people really really well. So we’ll start with the division president in our overlapping markets. We’ll have very open transparent conversations embedding of the talent, and then once we have those in place, we’ll continue through the management teams, obviously from a field standpoint and we are very excited about bring all of those members in to the Taylor Morrison family, but we will spend the next many weeks very very closely aligned with AV working on the people plan, because at the end of the day that’s the part we have to get right and that’s the part I am most confident in."
Matt Bouley,1,"All right. Appreciate the color, thank you."
Sheryl Palmer,1,Thank you.
Operator,1,Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Jack Micenko with SIG. Your line is now open.
Jack Micenko,1,"Morning. Sheryl, wanted to get your thoughts on brand, you know you’re moving into what looks like a lower price point entry and maybe a little bit of a lower price product point active adult, are you thinking about preserving some of that brand and keeping Taylor at some of the higher price points, and I guess, conversely some of their assets are pretty long dated and so there’s embedded brand there in the established business and just curious how you are thinking about it from a brand perspective?"
Sheryl Palmer,1,"Yes, of course. So as I said in my comments we will make a decision very very quickly between now and closing so we’ll be ready to go at closing on every community. I would tell you that we’ll handle it the same way we’ve done the other acquisitions as we’ve got communities that are just about to close out, probably in the next six months we won’t touch them, we’ll let those burn off, we won’t spend the dollars or the resources changing those over.
Everything else on the family side, you -- should expect to very quickly on day one the website will change to Taylor Morrison and everything else will very quickly be moved to the Taylor Morrison branding. The exception to that will be how we handle something like Solivita and we’ll spend time with that management team before that decision is made, but I would say couple of the long dated active adult to your point will decide if those become part of the Taylor Morrison’s branded family, but that’s the only thing that’s still up for debate."
Jack Micenko,1,"Okay, thanks. And then Dave, how are you thinking about deal cost. I think you in the prior question spoke to maybe some outside consulting fees and should we expect – how do we think about the breakdown of this cost in 2018 versus 2019?"
Dave Cone,1,"So I mean, first we’re going to have the transaction costs Jack which I would characterize as kind of normal and customary. Beyond that and underwriting, we put some estimates around some ongoing costs. They will be sizable, but I wouldn’t say overall material on a go-forward basis. The leverage that we think we’re going to be able to drive on the combined business will go towards paying some of that in the short term."
Jack Micenko,1,So maybe think about some more clarity on that in like a 2Q or 3Q call?
Dave Cone,1,"Yes, more likely once we get to the point of close."
Jack Micenko,1,"Okay, all right thanks."
Operator,1,Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of with Jay McCanless with Wedbush. Your line is now open.
Jay McCanless,1,"Hey good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just quickly on the 963 million, can you walk me through the the pieces that gets you to there, because just looking at where the debt was at the end of 1Q as that – that you get cash, it looks like there will be a smaller number."
Dave Cone,1,"Well it gets down to what you are using as their share count, which we have somewhere in the 22.8 multiplied against the 2150 and then it’s the assumption of debt which is on their books slightly less than 400 million for the six and five eights plus 80 million in the convert."
Jay McCanless,1,"Okay, so netting the…"
Dave Cone,1,560
Jay McCanless,1,"Okay, but that’s not netting that cash against that, that’s just assuming…"
Dave Cone,1,"No, not netting the cash."
Jay McCanless,1,"Okay, all right. Just want to make sure on that. The second question I had the DTA, they had roughly a 71 million DTA, or you’re going to be able to get any benefit from that?"
Dave Cone,1,"It’s a great question and the answer is yes. I mean, we’ll have, we’ll be subject to some of the 3D2 [ph] limitation, but we work through the DTA in great detail and believe we are going to get the vast majority of that, we’ll loose very little."
Jay McCanless,1,"Okay, okay. And then the third question I have is TPG, are they going to take all stock in this or they are going to take the ratio like the rest of the shareholders if necessary?"
Dave Cone,1,"Yes, they will like it obviously to be supportive of the transaction and will take all stock."
Sheryl Palmer,1,"Yes, and then they could be prorated down based on the converged, but at this point they will take all stock."
Jay McCanless,1,"Okay, and the last question I have is there are longer dated assets I think there is almost 5000 acres in Florida in an around Solivita, can you talk about do you guys have to take any step up in basis of that, you know that’s a long dated asset, and then also maybe just give us any color about what type of purchase counting impact we might expect on a pro steel basis."
Dave Cone,1,"You know I’ll take you back to the acquisition out of 1x1 book, so there will be some step up overall. I mean the reality of this, there is going to be some assets that might be stepped up, might take some down, but that’s a lot of the work that we’ll do here over the next several months as we do fair valuation on all the assets, we’ve done some preliminary work there, and we will have purchase accounting impact that we’ll see, that will roll through in the fourth quarter of this year and into 2019."
Jay McCanless,1,"Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions."
Operator,1,Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Alex Rygiel with B.Riley FBR. Your line is now open.
Alex Rygiel,1,"Two quick questions, first with regards to other synergies, can you help us to better understand the timeline and then secondly, what is this telling us more about the broad view of land costs today to acquire versus possibly public market valuations of companies and how Wall Street is feeling with land value?"
Dave Cone,1,"Yes, I’ll start with the synergy. It will probably -- we’ll see that on an annualized basis in 2020, but we’ll start getting the vast majority of that through 2019."
Sheryl Palmer,1,"You know on the land side, I’d go back to the comments I already made to be honest, we are very excited to being able to acquire the set of 1x1 book and to be able to get this greater debt within our underserved segment. I think we’ve heard for a couple of years it’s difficult out there and to get this sort of concentrated portfolio in the markets we’re in it feels really good, I mean land costs are not going backwards and to be able to put this kind of land at this basis in front of the business is exactly what we need to do."
Alex Rygiel,1,Thank you.
Sheryl Palmer,1,Thank you.
Operator,1,"Thank you. And I’m showing no further questions in the queue. So now, it would be my pleasure to hand the conference back over to Mrs. Sheryl Palmer, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer for some closing comments and remarks."
Sheryl Palmer,1,"Well thank you very much for joining us on this short notice this morning, and we look forward to keeping you updated as the year progresses. Have a wonderful day."
Operator,1,"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude our program and we may all disconnect. Everybody have a wonderful day."
