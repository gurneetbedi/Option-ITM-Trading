Please note that this call is being recorded today, November 23, 2018, at 1:30 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time.
I will now turn the call over to Monsieur Mathieu Lapage, Director Finance and Treasurer, please go ahead Mr. Lapage."
Mathieu Lapage,0,
"Thank you, Jessa. Good afternoon. And welcome to Valener’s fourth quarter and full year 2018 conference call. With me today from Énergir are Sophie Brochu, President and Chief Executive Officer and Éric Lachance, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, both acting as managers of Valener. Please not that this call is being webcast, so I encourage you to download the supporting slides, which are available in the Investors section of Valener’s Web site under Events & Presentations.",0,"As always, certain subjects we will cover involve forward-looking information. Please refer to the cautionary notes section, which can be found on the second page of our presentation, as well as in our annual MD&A that was published earlier today and is available on our Web site and on SEDAR.
During the course of this presentation, we may also refer to certain indicators that are non-U. S. GAAP financial measures and should not be considered in isolation or as substitute for other performance measures that are in accordance with GAAP.
With that being said, I will turn the call over to Sophie."
Sophie Brochu,0,"Good afternoon, everyone. Valener generated adjusted net income of $54.1 million in 2018, up 2% from '17. That's an adjusted EPS of $1.39 for 2018, an increase of $0.02 per share compared to the year before. For Q4, a seasonally slower quarter, Valener's adjusted net loss was $0.01 per share compared to an adjusted net loss of $0.07 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017. And for Énergir, Valener’s main holding, it generated $234.6 million of adjusted net income for 2018, up 3% from last year and as such, setting a new high in the Company’s history.
Of note, through the end 2018 net income was initially expected to come in about $16 million lower than ’17, instead driven by volumes that to grow to levels above the peak reach in 2000, net income for Québec distribution business came in $12.4 million higher than the original rate case forecast. What’s more, each of Énergir’s other operating segments contributed to the Company’s new high by generating higher year-over-year earnings. Strong 2018 results at Énergir also translated into record net income for Valener.
If you will, let’s take a minute to recap the commercial highlights of this year. I am now on Slide 4. Following the completion of the Standard Solar acquisitions in 2017, we had focused our efforts on reshaping the business model and signing new clients. As of September 30th, Standard Solar had 20 megawatts of solar projects in service and another 35 megawatts under construction. While it is taking a bit longer than expected, we continue to believe that Standard Solar will be able to add about 100 megawatts a year of capacity. To continue with solar, in the GMP 2019 rate case, it encompass three solar projects for a total of 14.4 megawatts, which coupled with integrated on site Tesla battery pack of 6 megawatt, would represent $30 million investment. Once approved by the regulators, we expect GMP to put these in service in 2019.
Moving on to natural gas transportation. The work that will ultimately lead to the increased capacity at PNGTS began last August. TQM is adding compression at the East Hereford Station. The work is expected to be completed towards the end of 2019. The additional capacity at PNGTS should then be available by the fall of 2020. Almost all of the future customers do their regulatory approval to contract their forecasted volumes. In the short term, it will increase the volume transported by PNGTS and secure some of the contracts that are expiring in 2019. Speaking of additional volumes, subsequent to its announcement in its latest budget, the Québec government is following through with an RFP to supply to Côte-Nord and Northern Québec with liquefied natural gas. One of Québec’s only regions without access to natural gas despite its heavy industrial load, the Côte-Nord conversion to natural gas will reduce the emission of both CAG and air pollutants. Énergir participated in the RFP and we expect the decision next spring.
If you’ve been following us for a while, which we believe, you now know that the valorization of residual materials is an intelligent solution to Québec’s energy needs, all while contributing to the reduction of GHG emissions. To that effect, our strategic ambitions for graining Énergir’s network are aligned with the objective of the government of Québec. Last August, the government published the gas regulation with regard to the quantity of natural gas to be delivered by a distributor. According to this regulation, the minimum content of renewable natural gas distributed by CDA would need to reach 1% of distributed volume by fiscal 2020. This would then gradually increase to 5% as of fiscal 2025.
Achieving these levels will eventually require CDA to inject nearly 300 million cubic meters of RNG into its network, and we will do that. We will be increasing our RNG supply, not just because the government will be regulating and supply levels and just because we see value in graining our network and contributing to the energy transition, but because the demand is there. But since finding on L'Oreal's Canada last December as our first consumer of RNG, for other clients have now also signed RNG supply agreement with Energir. As of now, we are committed to purchasing approximately 13 million cubic meter of RNG per year from the city of Saint-Hyacinthe for 20 years.
Today, the portfolio of products we offer is even more green. Our energies range from natural gas in both gas and liquid forms to renewable natural gas, as well as hydro, wind and solar electricity production. Energir offers increasingly diverse and low carbon energies in a geographic area that includes not only Quebec, but also spans now over a dozen U.S. states. Going forward, Energir remains on the lookout for opportunities, opportunities to invest in projects to more actively participate in reducing the environmental footprint of the energy sector. This ability to act, see and create business opportunities defines us and prepares us for the future.
I will now turn the call over to Éric who will walk you through the firm financial performance."
Éric Lachance,0,"Thank you, Sophie. On to Slide 5, Valener generated adjusted net income of $54.1 million in fiscal 2018, an increase of 2% from fiscal 2017. On a per share basis, adjusted net income increased by $0.02 and $1.39 compared to $1.37 in 2017. These results were driven by growth at Energir and strong and consistent power production at the Seigneurie de Beaupré farm although compensated by the increased financing cost at Valener.
For Q4, a typically tougher quarter given weather patterns and warmer temperatures, Valener adjusted net loss was $0.01 per share compared to a net loss of $0.07 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017. Normalized operating cash flows were $57.6 million in fiscal 2018, up 3% from last year. Growth from higher distribution received from Energir as a result of subscribing to additional units of Energir in March 2017, as well as Energir increasing its quarterly distribution from $0.29 per unit to $0.30 per unit as of the first quarter of 2018. Offsetting these elements were $2.1 million increase in income taxes paid arising from a timing difference and $600,000 increase in net interest expense. For the fourth quarter, Valener generated normalized operating cash flows of $19.5 million, up 8% from the fourth quarter of 2017 essentially for the reason I just mentioned.
On to Slide 6, Energir generated adjusted net income of $234.6 million in fiscal 2018, up 3% from an already strong 2017. All of the segments contributed to this increase. As guided at the beginning of the year, growth in the asset bases for both GMP and VGS are the main drivers for this increase. For the second year in a row, growth in consumptions from the small and medium load sectors in Québec growth over earnings at QDA that mostly offset all of the expected decline in QDA’s result with the growth in the asset bases of GMP and VGS, contributed to the strong results. On a per unit basis, Énergir generated adjusted net income of $1.37 per unit in 2018, an increase of $0.02 per unit from 2017. For the fourth quarter reflecting the typical warmer weather between July and September, Énergir ensured an adjusted net loss of $3.4 million compared to a net loss of $14.2 million in the fourth quarter of last year.
On to Slide 7, QDA generated adjusted net income of $45.1 million in’18, [$2.5] million from fiscal 2017. As Sophie just mentioned, although, the parameters of 2018 rate case led us to forecast the $14.9 million decrease in net income year-over-year the strong Québec economy drove net income to exceed initial estimates by $12.4 million. Last December, the Régie de l'énergie confirmed that QDA’s authorized ROE for fiscal 2019 will remain at 8.9%. And just a few weeks ago, the Régie authorized a 2.6% decrease in average global rate and $39 million increase in the average rate base. This brings QDA’s authorized rate base to $2.157 billion and we can expect QDA’s 2019 net income to be about $130.2 million. This is lower than what we have been expected in 2018 rate case, mainly as a result of the decline in the normal rate base investment as shown on Slide 8.
On to Vermont on Slide 9, Énergir’s operation generated adjusted net income of $106.7 million, up $3.6 million from last year. The increase in GMP and VGS average asset base had a positive impact on results, while the appreciation of the Canadian dollar slightly offset this impact. As of to-date, GMP is still expecting a decision from the VPUC on its 2019 rate case. This decision should be received before the end of the fiscal year. By far it called for an average rate base of $1.563 billion sorry, rate on return on common equity of 9.3% and an equity thickness of 49.8%. The average asset base if approved would represent 9% increase over last year, mainly from investments in the property, plants and equipment and transport and in new solid projects for about 13 megawatts.
The rate case also includes the credits customer from the tax reform that will offset increases within the rate year. In October, the VPUC approved the agreement reached between VGS and the VDPS providing for 4% increase in base rates. The agreement also provide for an average asset base of $255.5 million. In natural gas transportation on Slide 10, we recorded $20.2 million adjusted net income during the year compared to $18 million in fiscal 2017. This increase is mainly due to higher volume being transported by PNGTF under new long-term contract. As Sophie explained earlier, the extension alert began recently and as such, we expect the segment results to be similar next year.
In electricity production, we recorded $4.4 million adjusted net income during the year compared to adjusted net income of zero in fiscal 2017. Driving the result is the positive impact of the HLBV method the account for tax equity partnership, partly offset by operating losses at Standard Solar. Wind observed and power production at the Seigneurie de Beaupré Wind Farms have reached new high. The 10% increase in production resulted in a higher net income and $9 million more in operating cash flows compared to 2017. Accordingly, the wind farm stood up higher distribution this year, returning $39.3 million to the partners in 2018 compared $33.7 million in 2017.
On to Slide 11, in energy services, storage and other, we generated adjusted net income of $8.8 million, up $2.4 million from fiscal 2017. The decrease is attributable to improved margins at their district heating and cooling business and another service business. We have increased our deliveries of energy but we now allocate 22% of the income to the partner and this is not Quebec since the additional capacity was put in service.
Énergir’s corporate affairs segment is reporting an adjusted net loss of $50.6 million, an increase in expenses of $3.8 million from last this. This is mainly driven by higher financing cost due to the 12 month impact of long-term debt issued last year and generally higher variable interest rates, also impacting the all-in structure changes that we measure in the first quarter of the year. Énergir invested approximately $493 million in CapEx in fiscal 2018 in line with the expectations from last quarter. Q4 CapEx total $116.4 million and included among others investment at the SSI toward new development of solar parts, as well as usual maintenance and capital expenditures.
For 2019, we expect CapEx to range between $5.5 and $5.75 million, including investment in affiliates as we continue investing in particular in reinforcing our network and supporting the SSI expansion initiative. We are very pleased with this result at both Énergir and Valener level, and as we said we will do, Valener is increasing its quarterly dividend on common shares from $0.29 per share to $0.30 per share in order to meet the 4% CAGR target on common dividend from 2018 to 2022.
That concludes the call. Operator, we will now open the line for questions."
Operator,1,Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Jeremy Rosenfield from IA Securities. Please go ahead. 
Jeremy Rosenfield,1,"Can you talk a little bit about first, Standard Solar, just in terms of the timing and the evolution of the cash flow that you see coming out of standard solar? You mentioned Sophia off the top it's been a little bit slower than you would've hope for. Just comment on that."
Éric Lachance,1,"Basically I would say that SSI was a slight drag on cash flows in 2018 based on what they have in the pipeline and under construction I would say it's going to be marginally positive in terms of operating cash flows for next year. Obviously, since the goal is still to invest that maturity above 100 megawatt per year is going to obviously need a lot of cash flows or CapEx."
Jeremy Rosenfield,1,"So in terms of when you would expect to see distributions from Standard Solar to Énergir, or recurring cash flow stream. Is that something that might be in place late 2019 or early 2020?"
Éric Lachance,1,"Well, honestly, depends on how you take your perspective. Since our goal is to grow the platform so as long as there is going to be good opportunity to invest the capital, we're going to be recycling the operating cash flows to grow the business further. So you really need to view it as contributing to the over full cash flows but in the sense of distribution, we intent to reinvest and growing the business at the time."
Jeremy Rosenfield,1,"And then just in terms of G&P and the solar projects that are highlighted, solar and storage projects that are highlighted there. Is that investment in addition to whatever is already in the rate case for 2019?"
Éric Lachance,1,"No, they are part of the 2019 rate case the agreements in power."
Operator,1,[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Ben Pham from BMO. Please go ahead.
Ben Pham,1,"I just want to go over here your slide there showing the Énergir utility in Quebec, and you got the earnings you thought is $130 million, which is coming off $145 million. So the way you've always looked at that, I mean you've always excluded the quarter earnings, I believe that when you think about it. But is that over earnings -- that's just the volume difference versus the normalized volumes that are occurring in each year in rate case you apply for?"
Éric Lachance,1,The reason is really is driven by the -- from the actual of the volume that were realized versus what was in the rate case of 2018.
Ben Pham ,1,"And then so when you file a rate case, you have ready for 2019 rates the volumes in there that's based on 30 year average versus just picking up the higher volumes that you see in '18?"
Éric Lachance,1,"It is actually based on a very complex model that got in prediction. But to try to answer your question more directly, basically, when we did the rate case last year, we filed a little bit earlier than usual. So we didn’t add into the model the impact of the strong currently growth that we have in 2017 at the time of filing, which is not the case this year where we have taken into account the fact that '17 was strong and 2018 was also going strong. So basically, you should not expect to us such huge discrepancies in volumes all things being equal."
Ben Pham ,1,"So something that benefits is in '19 rates then and then the other portion is -- your non-rate base that just starts to amortize down each year. I think I have seen $700 million to $800 million or so, and that’s creating a little bit of headwind on the earnings."
Éric Lachance,1,"Yes, this amortization is very dependent on the decision from the AG with respect to the cap and trade. So we still haven’t got it. So honestly, we cannot afford gas on it."
Ben Pham ,1,"And then last thing, I was wondering I guess when you guys talk about the dividend trajectory 4%, and I think last you did 5% earnings growth. This year it's a little bit less at 3%, so you average 4%. But then when you get into '19, you have some declines in Quebec, but you have growth in other areas. So was the dividend -- was it always based on the $130 million Gaz Métro -- Énergir Gaz Métro earnings rather than $145 million?"
Éric Lachance,1,"The way I will answer it is the beauty of the regulatory model is you learn to grow and as such to grow your dividends, or you have the cash flow because you are not growing. So basically, we are confident that the 4% can be maintained."
Operator,1,There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.
Mathieu Lapage,1,"Thank you to everyone who participated on this call. Our first quarter 2019 conference call will be as expected on February 8, 2019. I wish to all a great, great weekend."
Operator,1,Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.
