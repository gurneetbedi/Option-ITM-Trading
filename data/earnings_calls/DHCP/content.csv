Operator,0,"Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Ditech Holding Corporation First Quarter 2018 Financial Results Presentation. All participants will remain in a listen-only mode throughout the duration of this presentation.
I would now like to introduce you to Jerry Lombardo, Chief Financial Officer of Ditech Holding Corporation who’ll begin today’s conference. Jerry, please begin."
Jerry Lombardo,0,"Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Ditech Holding Corporation’s first quarter 2018 earnings call. This call is being hosted live from our headquarters in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, and will be recorded and archived on our website for at least 30 days.
Please note that our first quarter 2018 earnings release and slide presentation have been released and are available on our Investor Relations website for your review. Also speaking on today’s call will be Ditech Holding Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board Tom Marano.
This morning, we will discuss earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 as well as our current business outlook. Let me remind you that comments on the call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. These statements are based on the Company’s current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the statements.
Please refer to our SEC filings for a full discussion of the risk factors that may affect any forward-looking statements. Except for any obligation to disclose material information under federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after this conference call.
We will discuss non-GAAP financial measurements during this call. We believe that these measurements provide investors useful information about our business trends. However, our non-GAAP measures do not replace and are not superior to GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP in the tables attached to the earnings release we issued earlier today and the presentation accompanying this call as well as with the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Ditech’s 2017 10-K and the first quarter 2018 10-Q, which are also available on our corporate website.
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I want to address the delay in the release of our first quarter earnings and the filing of the related Form 10-Q. As previously disclosed, due to variety of factors such as the delayed filing of our 10-K earlier this year as well as certain accounting and financial reporting matters including the application of fresh start, the Company required additional time to complete its first quarter financial closing procedures and our auditors required additional time to complete their interim review of the Company’s first quarter consolidated financial statements.
In connection with the finalization of the Company’s fresh start accounting mark, complex tax matters arose that needed to be analyzed by the Company and its advisors prior to releasing its first quarter earnings. This tax matter has been resolved. And I want to thank our investors and other interested parties for being patient with us as we worked diligently to file our 10-Q.
I will now turn the call over to Tom."
Tom Marano,0,"Thanks, Jerry. Good morning and thank you to everyone joining us on the call today. Ditech Holding Corporation reported net income of $467 million for the first quarter of 2018. While this is certainly positive news, it is important to recognize that our net income includes a $464.5 million of gains relating to our reorganization and fresh start accounting adjustments.
Overall, during the first quarter, the Company was negatively impacted by increasing interest rates and challenges in its Originations segment, but we are laser-focused on reducing costs across all of our business lines and generating sufficient origination volume to be become operationally profitable in 2018.
Ditech Holding Corporation is an independent servicer and originator of mortgage loans as well as a servicer of reverse mortgage loans. We are based in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, and have approximately 3,700 employees and service a diverse loan portfolio.
I joined the Board of Ditech on February 9, 2018 and became CEO on April 13th, in order to help accelerate the transformation of the Company into a profitable operation. Having spent the majority of my career in mortgage trading and originations, I am excited to have the opportunity to lead Ditech as CEO. Some other recent additions to the management team include Jerry Lombardo, who joined Ditech on February 9th, as CFO, and Ritesh Chaturbedi who joined as
Ditech’s Chief Operating Officer on April 23rd. I direct you to our website for bios of our new officers.
We also hired Andrew Badstubner as our new CTO. Andrew has extensive experience in technology and its start-ups such as Kabbage. These appointments demonstrate the new Board’s commitment to building a senior management team with a diverse background in finance, operations, mortgage and technology. These new additions join a great leadership team at Ditech. And I am confident in our ability to drive our next phase of growth and profitability by continuing to optimize our business and improve our customer experience.
I would also like to take a moment to thank Jeff Baker, the President of RMS, our reverse mortgage business, for his service as interim CEO and President of Ditech earlier this year. The Company will continue to benefit from Jeff’s leadership in his current role as President of RMS.
I would like to draw your attention to slide three, which highlights our recent financial restructuring initiatives. The Company announced it was pursuing a Prepackaged Plan in November of 2017. The Bankruptcy Court approved and amended Prepackaged Plan on January 17th of 2018 and entered a confirmation order approving the Prepackage Plan the following day. On February 9, 2018, the Prepackage Plan became effective pursuant to its terms and Walter Investment Management Corp. emerged from the Chapter 11 case under the new name Ditech Holding Corporation, marking the completion actual restructuring initiative. The restructuring process discharged approximately $800 million of corporate debt, yet the Company remains highly leveraged.
As of March 31, the Company had equity of $130.2 million, supporting $1.3 billion of corporate debt. Our operating businesses are well-capitalized in regard to net worth covenant requirements. Under the terms of the Company’s 2018 credit agreement, the Company paid down $118.1 million in the first quarter of 2018 and will face significant debt obligations going forward with $17.5 million of quarterly principal amortization payments due through the end of 2018.
As part of the restructuring, senior unsecured notes of $538.7 million were cancelled and noteholders received $250 million in second lien notes, maturing December 2024, and $100 million in convertible preferred stock. Convertible notes of $242.5 million were cancelled and noteholders received 2.1 million shares of common stock, 3.6 million Series A warrants and 2.9 million Series B warrants. Additionally, Walter Investment Management Corp. common stock was cancelled and stockholders received 2.1 million shares of common stock, 3.6 million Series A warrants and 2.9 million Series B warrants.
The Company emerged from bankruptcy with a nine-member Board of Directors comprised of six new members and three members from the Walter Investment Management Board. In addition to my role as CEO, I am serving as Chairman of the Board. The Board has a mix of finance, operations and technology skills, and a focus on driving the business to profitability and growth as quickly as possible.
Since our emergence as Ditech Holding Corporation, a name that is derived from digital technology, we intend to focus on our customers and leverage technology to create a better mortgage experience. Our focus on our customers and technology is intended to deliver consistent profitability in the future.
Slide four will set the tables for the current market environment and certain external market factors that have challenged our first quarter 2018 results and are expected to have an impact on our performance during the remainder of 2018. As you know, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark rate three times in 2017. Citing healthy economic factors, the Fed raised its benchmark rate another 25 basis points to 1.5% to 1.75% target range on March 21st. The market is currently pricing in two more Fed rate hikes in 2018.
Treasury and mortgage rates initially rose putting more pressure on refinance activity. Over time, mortgage rates have dropped a bit as originators have reduced margins to maintain volumes. Nevertheless, industry refinance as a percentage of total mortgage activity continues to decline and hit its lowest point in 10 years to 35% during the first quarter, as you can see in the chart on the bottom left of slide four.
The rising rate environment in the first quarter of 2018 was also a factor in margin compression within the industry. In general, it is currently a difficult mortgage originations environment, and Ditech is not immune to these conditions.
Delinquencies continued to decline across the industry and in our portfolio as well, due in part to sustained job growth and recent wage growth, which helps borrowers stay current. These factors along with the continuing home price appreciation are expected to reduce the opportunities for mortgage refinancing and increase the demand for home equity loans and purchase loans.
Although these market conditions are challenging, we are adjusting our business model to be in a better position to make money in this environment. Actions we are taking that are designed to drive growth in our originations business include, increased focus on purchase lending, exploring expanded product offerings, enhancing our digital marketing presence, pursuing new lead sources and simplifying our processes. We are focused on improving our customer experience and are seeking to implement innovative solutions to make our loan origination process more convenient for our customers.
As for the servicing market, increases in MSR values were seen in the first quarter of 2018 due to rising interest rates and an estimated industry wide MSR portfolio value growth of 7% to 15%, which occurred through March 2018. We recognized a $71.6 million positive fair value adjustment on our MSR.
Turning to slide five, I want to highlight a number of key facts about our franchise. As of March 31, 2018, our subsidiary Ditech Financial was the 12th largest servicer in the industry with more than 1.5 million servicing customers and a UPB of $183.7 billion. Ditech Financial’s Servicing segment reported pre-tax income of $71.7 million as of March 31, 2018, an increase of $23.4 million compared to the prior year quarter. Additionally, the Servicing segment generated revenue of $202.4 million, an increase of $54.6 million as compared to the prior year quarter. Our MSR portfolio increased by $71.6 million due to valuation adjustments; however, it was offset by sales of $11.4 million. Ditech owns mortgage servicing rates with a fair value of approximately $730 million as of March 31, 2018.
Ditech Financial reported a 30 plus day delinquency rate of 8.55% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. That is down from 10% from the prior year quarter. Ditech Financial is a well-capitalized operating subsidiary in the consumer direct lending marketplace. Ditech Financial generated total pull-through adjusted lock volume of $2.8 billion for the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of $2.1 billion as compared to the prior year quarter. Funded loans as of March 31, 2018 totaled $2.8 billion, a decrease of $2.2 billion from the prior year quarter.
The Originations segment delivered a recapturing of 20% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Our Originations segment based on UPB is comprised of 17% HARP refinancings, 38% non-HARP refinancings and 45% purchase loans. 
Reverse Mortgage Solutions is an active servicer in the reverse mortgage market with a service UPB of $19.1 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Our Reverse segment generated revenue of $18 million in the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of $4.5 million from the prior year quarter. Net interest income on reverse loans and HMBS related obligations increased $5.7 million, primarily due to an increase in buyouts, which were $391.7 million of reverse loans and ROE during the first quarter of 2018.
Now that we have gone over the current market environment and Ditech Holding Corporation’s position within the current market, I will turn the call over to Jerry to provide a brief overview of our first quarter 2018 financial results. Jerry?"
Jerry Lombardo,0,"Thank you, Tom.
Let me begin by reviewing the highlights of our first quarter results. In the first quarter of 2018, we reported consolidated pretax income of $467 million compared to pretax income of $4.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The consolidated pretax income of the first quarter of 2018 includes a reorganization gain and adjustment from fresh start -- adjustments from accounting totaling 464.5 million. The prior year quarter included a $67 million gain on the sale of substantially all of our insurance business.
We reported an average serviced UPB of $186.6 billion across 1.5 million units during the first quarter, which represents a decrease from 1.9 million units in the first quarter of 2017. This decrease in units drove lower servicing fees in revenue of $137.4 million, down from $171.8 million in Q1 2017. Our first quarter results were positively impacted by $71.6 million from MSR valuation adjustments.
The Company had funded by $2.8 billion in Q1 2018 with 36% of these loans funded in the consumer channel and 64% of these loans funded in the correspondent and wholesale channels. This volume was down significantly from the $5 billion of funded volume in the prior year quarter, driving a $17.9 million decrease in the net gain on sale.
Expense results for the first quarter of 2018 excluding interest expense reflected a decrease of $42.6 million or 17%, as compared to the prior year quarter due to a reduction in legal fees, lower contracting costs, lower default servicing expense and lower loss reserves for advances. The decrease in expenses reported for the first quarter of 2018 was also a result of a $20.8 million decrease in compensation and benefits from organizational changes across the operating segments and corporate support functions.
Headcount has been reduced by approximately 800 employees or 18% to a base of 3,700 employees. These decreases were partially offset by higher interest expense of $8.2 million and an impairment to goodwill and intangible assets as of March 31, 2018 of $10 million.
Let’s move to slide seven and discuss fresh start accounting. After emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy on February 9, 2018, we met the requirements under GAAP and adopted fresh start accounting. GAAP requires us to report our results separately for the period after emergence, which is the period from February 10, 2018 through March 31, 2018 in the period prior to emergence, which is a period from January 1, 2018 through February 9, 2018. Any presentation of the successor represents the financial position and results of operations of the successor and will not be comparable to prior periods.
For the first quarter of 2018, we recorded reorganization gains and fresh start accounting adjustments of $464.5 million, which included a gain on debt cancellation of $556.9 million and fresh start accounting adjustments of $77.2 million. This gain was partially offset by the issuance of equity to senior unsecured and convertible noteholders of $153.8 million and expenses incurred of $15.9 million related to this Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding.
Goodwill of $9 million was recorded in connection with fresh start accounting on February 9, 2018 but was written off in its entirety as of March 31, 2018 due to the underperformance in our Originations segment. We also took a $1 million charge to our intangible assets due to the impact of loan originations and run off of our servicing portfolio.
Moving on to the Company’s balance sheet and liquidity position on slide eight. Cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2018 equaled $216.8 million, which reflects a decrease of $69.2 million as compared to December 31, 2017. This decrease was driven by $23.2 million of cash used upon reverse Ginnie Mae buyout loans and REO inventory. Payment of principal and interest on our corporate debt of a $136.9 million including a payment of $118.1 million at upon emergence and cash posting of $19.5 million to replace letters of credit. These outflows were mitigated by net proceeds of a $106.8 million from the sale of servicing rights.
Our financing facility is executed upon emerging from bankruptcy provided an aggregate of $1.9 billion of financing capacity to fund newly originated mortgage loans, servicer advances and repurchases of buyout from Ginnie Mae securitization pools.
On April 23, 2018, RMS entered into a new warehouse facility to finance buyout that RMS has required to repurchase from Ginnie Mae securitization with an initial committed capacity of $200 million and uncommitted of 12; this capacity was additive to the $1.9 billion of exit facility financing capacity.
I’ll now turn the call back to Tom to provide some color on certain initiatives that are underway at the Company before we wrap up."
Tom Marano,0,"Thanks, Jerry.
As mentioned earlier, our senior leadership team is focused on improving the operating results of the Company and continuing to execute on initiatives that will improve processes, reduce expenses, enhance the culture and advance the Company’s transformation. I’m going to give a brief highlight of each of our business segments and discuss initiatives we are taking within each segment in an effort to reduce costs and become profitable.
First, let’s start with our Servicing segment. We are evaluating processes, technology and capacity across our Servicing segment to determine opportunity for improvement. Through the reengineering of processes and the implementation of technology solutions, we will be able to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our Servicing segment and in turn reduce our cost to service.
Additionally, we continue to evaluate our capacity and site footprint to reduce operational costs. We have been pursuing initiatives to enhance the customer experience, including the launch of customer initiatives program which is designed to make us more efficient in responding to the needs of our customers. Additionally, we have improved the training and enhanced the monitoring of our customer service personnel, and implemented new technology solutions designed to reduce errors and improve our self service experience.
Other efforts underway include the expansion of our business hours to more effectively cover the western time zones. This will also help us with providing new funding solutions to our western customers. These initiatives along with others are part of our efforts to optimize our Servicing segment and improve operations across all business lines.
Now, let’s review our Originations segment. We are focused on improving our originations technology and seeking new sources of business at prices that make economic sense to maintain our market share in a rising rate environment. As I mentioned before, we are transitioning our Originations segment from a HARP-focused refinance shop to a lender that is focused on the needs of customers in the purchase market.
We plan to expand our product offerings to provide solutions that our customers want and need, identifying new and profitable lead sources and expanding our business hours. The planned launch of an integrated consumer lending point of sales platform and a new consumer app is on target and expected to increase our ability to compete and bring in new customers. Additionally, we will seek to reduce our cost to originate and reduce lending risk and improve execution throughout all areas of our originations business.
As for our Reverse Mortgage segment, we plan to seek to reduce the impact to liquidity of required Ginnie Mae buyouts through whole loan sales and implementation of new financing structures. We will also continue to work with industry peers and HUD in an effort to accelerate the timeline to process claims and on team reimbursement from HUD for insured loans. Additionally, we will work to automate processes and enhance the control and efficiencies of our reverse segment to reduce our cost to service.
As discussed earlier in the call, Ditech Holding Corporation has been through a lot of change in the past year. We have a solid leadership team in place and plan to continue to recruit top notch talent and will work hard each day to determine and take action on the steps necessary to put Ditech in a better position for the future. Operator?"
End of Q&A,1,"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This concludes today’s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day."
