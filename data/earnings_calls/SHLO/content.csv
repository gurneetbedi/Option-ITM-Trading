I will now turn the call over to Ramzi Hermiz, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Ramzi?"
Ramzi Hermiz,0,"Thank you Gary, good morning. Today I would like to begin with some comments on the industry and the progress that Shiloh has made transforming the company to a leading technology provider. The direction of technology and speed of change continued to redefine the mobility industry. The need for lightweighting of the vehicle remains critical either as an enabler for emissions reduction of internal combustion engines or for range extension of battery electric propulsion systems. Furthermore, component lightweighting counteracts the added weight of sensors, electronics and computer systems added in autonomous vehicles.
In 2013, we embarked on a multi-year strategy to transform ourselves from a regional metal processing company into a leading global supplier of lightweight technology and services. I’d like to highlight some of our accomplishments. Over the past 5 years, we have doubled our revenue and grown our leading technologies in structural aluminum and magnesium products from zero to nearly 30% of revenue. Over the past 4 years, we have grown our revenue from outside North America from zero to nearly 30%. We are gaining traction in China, we began production of Shiloh core dash panels in late 2015, added structural magnesium cross car beams in 2017 and celebrated the grand opening of our aluminum product manufacturing facility in April of 2018. 5 years ago, over 50% of our revenue was from just 3 OEMs are all headquartered in North America. Today, 54% of our revenue comes from 6 OEMs spread across 3 major continents. Our strategy is producing the intended results with continued opportunity in front of us. 
With that as an introduction, let’s review the 4 main topics, which I believe makes Shiloh an attractive investment opportunity. Our continued operating performance, our recent acquisition, active product launches and company’s profitable growth path and related market trends. Global revenue grew nearly 9% year-over-year in the second quarter to over $297 million. This is a new company quarterly record. This result was driven by both organic and acquisitive growth. We remain focused on improving our product mix, continuing to launch new lightweight solutions and further aligning our technologies with customer trends. Our value-added product offering is unique and leverages our multi-material capabilities that expand across all vehicle segments in all forms of propulsion, from internal combustion engines to full battery electric vehicles. This product and technology mix continues to support our longer-term profit and growth strategies. 
During the quarter, we made meaningful progress by increasing our aluminum and magnesium manufacturing presence with the acquisition of two European facilities from Brabant Alucast. The acquisition closed in March and represents a highly strategic and capital efficient way to capture meaningful new revenue and add significant growth capacity. It also boosts our scale and market share in key products. We are now one of the leading global manufacturers of magnesium cross car beams and one of the largest automotive structural magnesium component suppliers worldwide. 
We are leveraging Shiloh’s technology and customer relationships with this new capacity to create a solid profitable growth platform for the future. Our acquisition strategy is straight forward. We identify targets that fulfill specific needs such as innovative technology, geographic expansion or customer diversification. 
We have significant experience identifying underperforming businesses and converting them into higher performing assets. This strategy has allowed Shiloh to complete acquisitions at attractive multiples while providing the opportunity to improve results and generate higher returns. Brabant is a great example of our acquisition strategy in action. We acquired the assets at basically fair value resulting in minimal goodwill while paying modest transaction fees of less than 5% of the acquisition price.
We have begun to implement action plans and capture synergy opportunities to improve the operating performance of these facilities which will be accretive in 2019.
During the quarter, the annual contract value of new business wins increased by nearly 15% year-over-year as we won new business across our brands in all regions, Asia, Europe and North America. Europe represented approximately 25% of our revenue during the second quarter and will continue to increase given the full contribution from the Brabant facilities. 
In China, we are experiencing high interest in our technology as our product portfolio is supporting the growing local EV market. During the recent Beijing auto show, there were well over 100 different electric vehicles announced that are targeted for launch over the next few years. This represents a large opportunity for Shiloh given the recognition of our EV technology capabilities. 
We continue to strengthen our technology portfolio and customer profile while pursuing increased content per vehicle. We have made excellent progress over the last few years increasing our CPV from a $180 per targeted platform in 2016 to $195 in 2017 with our current rate now above $200 per vehicle, out of the approximately $1,500 market potential for our products. This equates to a 7x opportunity for CPV growth. 
We had a very active quarter for product launches and are excited to see our innovative solutions move into production. These launches are important milestones that mark the beginning of a new revenue stream. However, they do include front-loaded expenses. Effectively, we are transitioning from the capital expenditure phase to the launch and operating expense phase which will move into production later this year. As is customary with our launches, we expect these programs to reach profitability targets as volume ramps up to full production in early 2019. 
In addition to new launches, Q2 was a very busy period with all of exciting developments, such as the acquisition in March and launch of our new plant in Nantong in April as well as in Clarksville, Tennessee. We expect similar level of activity with an accelerated ramp up in Clarksville and the opening of a new state-of-the-art engineering lab in Plymouth, Michigan.
As it relates to restructuring, we have discussed many actions we are taking to manage market uncertainties by consolidating manufacturing facilities, eliminating lower margin products, creating a leaner and more flexible structure that has the ability to make Shiloh even more scalable and global company. We believe these strategic moves will result in stronger capabilities and a more efficient and focused footprint allowing the company to perform better and operate with lower fixed costs. We’ve made progress in these initiatives in the first half of fiscal 2018 and these efforts will continue over the next 12 to 18 months. 
With that, I will turn it over to Jay."
Jay Potter,0,"Thank you, Ramzi. As a reminder, our results this quarter include 2 months of contribution from the Brabant acquisition. Revenue in the second quarter increased by nearly 9% to 297.3 million, compared to 273 million in the second quarter of 2017. This is comprised of 0.3% organic growth, compared to a flat market and an 8.6% contribution from Brabant. We are pleased that we grew faster than the market in our two largest regions. 
In Europe, on a currency adjusted basis, we realized 3% organic growth outpacing customer production levels, which declined by 1%. In North America, we outpaced flat customer production levels and grew organically nearly 4% when excluding our intentional sun setting for the lower margin products. Our growth was driven by the continued ramp up of new product launches that began in the second half of 2017. Gross profit was 31.5 million in the second quarter, compared to 33.5 million in the second quarter of 2017, representing the gross margin of 10.6%.
The first half of 2018 finished with 59.4 million of gross profit, compared to 57.6 million in the first half of 2017, an increase of nearly $2 million. Margin in the quarter was impacted by Brabant as margins are below Shiloh levels. We expect improvement as we continue the integration and execution of their turnaround. Second, we had numerous launches both in new plan activity and products, which resulted in elevated upfront expenses. This negatively impacted profitability in the quarter but will benefit future periods. 
We remain focused on our product strategy, while pursuing opportunities for operational improvements. Our restructuring activities remained on plan during the second quarter and we incurred approximately 1.5 million of costs. As outlined in previous quarters, the total charge over 24-month period is expected to be approximately $17 million of which we have incurred nearly 8 million. As a reminder, the benefits from this initiative are expected to generate annualize savings of $7 million to $10 million by 2020 with savings beginning in 2019 generating less than a 3-year payback on a cash basis. 
For the second quarter, net income of $4 million was consistent compared to 4.2 million in the prior year quarter. For the first half of the year, net income improved by more than 300% to 8.9 million, compared to $2.2 million in the first half of fiscal 2017. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.24 compared to $0.36 in the year ago quarter. For the first half of the year, adjusted earnings per diluted share increased to $0.39, compared to $0.33 in the first half of fiscal 2017. A full reconciliation of these adjustments can be seen in our press release. 
For the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA was 20.3 million, compared to 24.5 million in the year ago quarter. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 6.8% versus 9% in Q2 of 2017. We incurred launch and acquisition related costs in the quarter, as well as additional investments in SG&A to support our growth in China and other locations that will benefit future periods. Adjusted EBITDA for the first half was 36.8 million compared to 38.9 million in the first half of 2017. During the second quarter, we generated operating cash flow of 8.4 million an improvement compared to 7.3 million in the year ago quarter and we invested $13.9 million in capital expenditures and $62.5 million in acquisitions net of cash required. Net borrowings under our revolving line of credit were $239.2 million, as a result of funding our acquisition, our leverage ratio increased to 3.25 times compared to 3.1 times in the year ago period. 
As we work to integrate the acquisition and improve results, we see leverage returning to the mid 2s over the next several quarters, a level we saw in Q1 prior to the acquisition.
With that, I'll now turn the call back to Ramzi for commentary on our outlook and some summary remarks."
Ramzi Hermiz,0,"Thank you, Jay. Turning to guidance. Our recent acquisition creates a significant strategic advantage structural aluminum capability in Europe and expanding our global magnesium capacity to meet growing customer and technology demands. We expect it will add annualized sales of more than $100 million with an additional capacity for growth. 
While we do not expect the acquisition to be additive to profitability in the current fiscal year, due to transaction expenses and ongoing investments made to integrate and improve the facilities, operational performance, we remain confident this transaction will be accretive in 2019. In the short-term the acquisition provides us with immediate capacity reducing the need for growth CapEx in other facilities. 
We are reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA guidance range for 2018 of $73 million to $76 million, which includes improved product mix and operating efficiencies in the base business, offsetting acquisition and integration costs as well as increasing raw material and launch costs. We anticipate an adjusted EBITDA margin range of 7% to 7.2% as a result of Brabant’s revenue and lower margin contribution and remain confident in our double-digit adjusted EBITDA margin target for 2020. 
Our strategy to transform Shiloh is delivering results. I am pleased with the accomplishments the team has made in; one, enhancing our product offering; two, strengthening our customer relationships; three, target and close on an excellent European acquisition opportunity; and four, launching Nantong and Clarksville.
We are demonstrating a consistent ability to deliver breakthrough technology and are well positioned to succeed in this dynamic market. 
Operator, we are ready to go to Q&A."
Operator,1,Thank you. We’ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question today comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. 
John Murphy,1,"Just a question on launch activity in the quarter. It sounded like it was a bit of a weight. I am just curious if that had to just do with what you have in your backlog that’s rolling on or was there some sort of disruption that went on to some of your customers as far as launches because it sounds like this is a heavy launch quarter for the industry at large and there were hiccups, not with you but the launches of the customers?"
Ramzi Hermiz,1,"From a standpoint, I would say it’s a combination of both when you look at the -- not only do we have launches, we basically launched not only product launches but launched two plants as well as started the integration of the Brabant acquisition. So, it was a heavy quarter with just activity going on. Some of our customers’ launches have been accelerated for various reasons, some have been slightly deferred where we’re already put the expense expecting to have shipped product. But because of other reasons they had to back off or they had to slow down. So, it was -- it's an active quarter especially when we look at year-over-year from a comparable. Nothing that I would say is a concern but definitely activity which is the positive -- a much of the business that we’ve won in the prior years are really starting to roll in, which we are much more excited about as we look going forward. So, the products in the Clarksville, products in Nantong, what we have going on in Europe, it is pretty exciting. "
John Murphy,1,"And that gets to the second question Ramzi. When we think about everything is going on, I mean you said, I think it was 15% growth in the backlog. The acquisition landscape looks like it’s open and there is deals to be done, it would be helpful. You’re talking about plan openings, expanding geographically. So, when you think about the capital requirements for the business, do you think, there is the need to potentially raise capital to take advantage of all this stuff, I mean particularly given the current leverage ratio or do you think the ongoing cash flow of the company will drive the funding of that growth?"
Ramzi Hermiz,1,"I would say that, we are looking at it and planning at a self-funded growth. One of the activities that really Brabant brought us, while, it was primarily and more of an asset transaction. What we got with them was significant available capacity for growth. So, what we have here is in Europe instead of needing to build another magnesium plant or to build an aluminum plant. This acquisition not only gave us revenue that we can improve their margins as we’ve demonstrated in the past that we can do in that spectrum, it also gives us available capability to nearly double that business or better said not spend capital elsewhere. So, we felt that this was, this acquisition and why we pursued it the way we did gave us that ability to self-fund some other activities. 
From an M&A standpoint, we’re always open to, and I’d say looking at activates. Obviously, the market knows we’re not afraid to do an acquisition when it makes sense, if it brings us technology, brings us a customer diversification geographic footprint. We’ll definitely pursue something like that. But like we did last year with the equity raise, it did provide us room to do something. We don’t see something in the immediate horizon, but we’re going to look at what landscape offers us and we will make sure that we do what’s best for long-term growth in the company."
John Murphy,1,"And then just lastly, I mean you mentioned sort of target EBITDA margins of low-double-digits by 2020. When we think about the capital intensity and all the growth that have in front of you. I mean, would it be a normalized CapEx in 2020 or will there still be a lot of growth capital going into the business and how should we think about sort of 'normalize' CapEx and go along with that low-double-digit EBITDA margin. I am not saying low-double-digit, I apologize, I think, I might have mischaracterized that."
Ramzi Hermiz,1,"What I would say, I feel comfortable with the 4% to 5% and this are probably 3 reasons, why I would look at it. One is as you know, we launched a restructuring plan last year and last fourth quarter. And that activity is accelerating or moving the launch. By the end of this year, we’ll have two facilities close. And I will circle back to restructuring. So, we’ll have that. So, then that freeze up capital to be redeployed in other facilities. So, there will be item one why I feel, I’m comfortable that we’ll have some additional capacity or capital once we deploy it. The Brabant acquisition as I mentioned brings us additional capital that we can leverage. And three, I would say and I’ve made this comment before, our industry has never been the best user of capital. So, we are really pushing hard on the return on capital. So how do we drive productivity and with productivity initiatives that we have increasing our operating efficiency, I will also free up additional capacity. So, I don’t feel at this time, we really have to move beyond the 4% to 5% and I think that’s a reasonable number considering the space we’re in and the opportunities in front of us. "
John Murphy,1,"And then just lastly on the backlog real quick. I mean, obviously it sounds like it was great growth and you’re expanding geographically. I mean, when you talk to customers and you’re going into through the big process and the acquisition for business and then going through the acquisition process of assets growing in China. I mean, is there certainly an endorsement that’s starting to build with your customer base that you would be the consolidator in your space, the vehicle and you may become a lot larger with obviously your efforts, but also with their rewards of more and more business overtime. Because it seems like what the early stages of this very potential large company down the line and their endorsement is going to be critical to getting there obviously. "
Ramzi Hermiz,1,"We were in China for the opening of the facility in April and one of the things that I would say while I knew was always the case it was really reaffirmed with some of the visits that we had on not only how they see our product but the value that our team in China is bringing really on the electric vehicle front. Because of our capabilities, we talk often of our lightweighting capabilities but really one of Shiloh’s strength is lightweighting in NVH, noise, vibration and harshness management. And one of the things in electric vehicle, they are so quiet and there’s so much other outside noise and high frequency noise from the motors, our line of ShilohCore products does an incredible job of dampening. So, what we found even in China not only are we being sought after for our lightweighting capabilities but our NVH opportunities, or our NVH management opportunities in electric vehicle. And as you know from your recent visits there, the EV side is that’s where we’re -- it’s expanding. China, the Beijing Auto Show, over a 100 -- I think the number was actually 174 different targeted electric vehicles, so we see that market from an NVH and lightweighting as significant. 
And there’s a customer recognition, we were with one of our US OEMs and we’re involved in their very early development stages on the vehicle architecture, again for some of the work that we’ve been doing in the EV sector for I’ll say a number of years from our customer in California, they did -- and eventually they had a couple of vehicles disassembled and they had Shiloh components all over the place didn’t recognized didn’t know that they were ours. But we’re looking to us how do we use that similar type technology in their new vehicle launches which will be or the new EVs which will be in North America and China. And interesting enough with AV with autonomous vehicles, AV in many cases equals EV and on an AV vehicle the battery drain for their technology is also foreseen lightweighting. So, we are seeing some of these mega trends actually driving the need for lightweighting as I made in my opening comments and we are seeing more acceleration in that area. So, we’re pretty pumped about it. "
Operator,1,The next question is from the line of Richard Carlson with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. 
Richard Carlson,1,"The 3% or the 0.3% organic growth was I think stronger than we were expecting. I think we were expecting with the sun setting for -- that to start coming down. But I think given where the margin level was, it seems like may be mix was negative in the quarter. So, I was just wondering if you could comment on that? And then if you could just let us know what the adjusted EBITDA margin would have been excluding Brabant?"
Ramzi Hermiz,1,"Starting with the latter, adjusted EBITDA without Brabant, we would say from the margins we would be comparable to where we were last year, so to put in at a high level. So obviously there was a number of expenses, part of the integration costs were all built into this year’s -- this quarter’s EBITDA margin.
When you look at mix, I would say mix was reasonable. As I mentioned a few moments ago, there was a lot of activity on the launch side. So, when you look at what we did, we are on track to I would say our plan when you look at I would say are lumpy, I’ll use that word for EBITDA last year each quarter one versus quarter two versus quarter three and versus quarter four, I see that this year you will see more of a leveling effect or a more balanced quarter-to-quarter move them some high lows that we saw last year. 
So, as we manage our launches, as we manage some of the integration as we planned, as we feel that that we’ll see that. So yes, mix did have a little bit of an impact. We actually had a lot of good -- we had a lot of prototype sales last year at this quarter, so those always have higher margins. So, you can put that in the mix category. And in respect of growth on the organic side, I think what you are also seeing is that better mix of moving our portfolio over the last couple years more to trucks and less to cars. So, we’ve seen that, so we, I think what you’re also seen some of the benefit associated to how we’ve managed the portfolio and as we look forward, as I talked about accelerating our restructuring plan. Well, we’ve launched in quarter 4 was in part, because we anticipated the mix shift. We anticipated that we needed to be it for NAFTA negotiations or other reasons, reallocate some of our capacity in different regions. We are, so these initiatives that we’ve launched last year are starting to all come into play and are leading to stronger and stronger, I’ll say, confidence in our targets, our midterm, longer-term targets."
Richard Carlson,1,"And then also I guess on Brabant, the back of the envelope on the contribution there I think is about $23.5 million just in 2 months. So, is this just seasonally time of the year? Or when you think about 100 million in annualized there, an assumption that you start purging some of the products there?"
Ramzi Hermiz,1,"Well, one of the things that, with Brabant, again this is a strong quarter from typically from a European side. So, there is a little bit of strength there. What we also see as this business is, I’d say a turn around and we recognize that, there was business that they were not winning. And part of the reason we, I’ll say, negotiated a very attractive price for this was they, they were going to lose some business. They didn’t get the replacement business. So, we knew that at the acquisition. We weren’t afraid of that, but it is part of that forward-looking revenue piece. 
Now what is, what we thought would happen did happen within the week of after acquiring the business. We have already won awards, business awards both on the aluminum casting side, which we were not aluminum casting in Europe. So, the fact that Shiloh’s name is hanging over the door. With the really talented team, so I got, make the comment. Let me make one comment first, the team that and the people that we acquired through this acquisition extremely talented team. We got some great engineers, great leaders, great sales team, it’s really going to help us develop our European business. What the customer base was concerned with, was the ongoing ownership of the private equity firm and what was their strategy. 
So, they, the customers were not confident and awarding business, not because of Brabant’s technology, not because of the quality of the people, but because of their ownership structure. So as soon as we change that strategic coming in, somebody focused on growth who can develop this, we’ve already seen business awards. So, we’re comfortable that while it won’t impact new revenue growth per say in Brabant and revenue next year, it does help the future. But what Brabant also bring again immediately is the rebalancing of production in Shiloh, but also for the business awards, we had previously one, we would have had to build or expand in Poland. 
Now we don’t need to do that. We’re going to leverage those Brabant facilities in essence immediately. And so that’s part of the integration activity that we’re doing right now is rebalancing our Poland facility, which was working 7 days a week. Now we’re being able to put that in that some of that available capacity instead of spending new capital. We’re able to redeploy in this case we’re used the Brabant capacity to manage that. So, when we, as I mentioned earlier, when we look at this, there was a number of strategic regions why it made sense and then back to the earlier question from John about future CapEx. We would have had to spend immediate CapEx in ’19 and again an additional ’18 for more capacity. Now we don’t need that. That’s actually part of the acquisition price, which we both potentially could be $200 million of revenue capacity for what it would cost us to build a $50 million revenue magnesium plant. So, this is really a great accelerator for future growth. "
Richard Carlson,1,"Got it. And then also first negative free cash flow quarter in a couple of years, I mean was that also pretty much driven by Brabant and then how do we think about that for full year?"
Ramzi Hermiz,1,"Full year I think we would see an overall positive number. I think this is more again back to the significant amount of activity in the quarter. We spent a fair amount of capital as we launched. We had Brabant. We had some of the integration. I would say don’t get used to seeing that, so -- or you shouldn’t have to get used to seeing that."
Richard Carlson,1,"Right. Seems like a little unexpected as you guys obviously had pretty strong free cash flow generator so just wonder as we model how to incorporate that in. And then just last modeling question, tax rate was of course a little lower than expected. How do we think about that now and then I assume some of that was driven by the Jobs Tax Act?"
Ramzi Hermiz,1,"Can you repeat that question, I am sorry?"
Richard Carlson,1,The effective tax rate for the quarter was lower than we were expecting which I assume some of that is still from working through all the US the tax reform acts but how do we think about that for the full year and actually even going forward beyond that?
Jay Potter,1,"Yes, Richard, you are exactly right, that was on continued adjustments due to the tax laws in the quarter. As we look out longer term we think we’ll land around that statutory rate right around 21.2% as we look ahead. "
Operator,1,"[Operator Instructions]. The next question is from the line of [George Casper], a private investor. Please go ahead with your question. "
Unidentified Analyst ,1,First question ask here is could you identify your new total parts launches in the first half this year and what you expect in total parts launches for this third and fourth quarters on a relative basis?
Ramzi Hermiz,1,"Are you talking about the number of parts, George?"
Unidentified Analyst ,1,"The number of parts, yes. The number of new parts."
Ramzi Hermiz,1,"Probably 50, may be a 100. I mean that’s not -- I would track it by program George because a program is, could be 20, 30, 50 part numbers in a program because of the assembly and the work we do. So, we probably have 10 large programs that we are launching currently in this quarter and which could be 100 parts. I mean it’s -- I’d be better prepared for that question next time, so don’t worry about it. And then when you look at it for the second half versus the first half, those start going into production. I would say we would expect half that amount in the second half of this year because of a lot of these are the customers’ model years where they’re going into production for 2019. So, as we get to the back half of the year, those are really already for the most part being launched."
Unidentified Analyst ,1,"And in your compression systems cost structures associated with new parts production, is obviously an upfront cost, correct? And obviously that would impact your initial start-ups of new parts production. "
Ramzi Hermiz,1,"We understand when you’re saying compression, are you talking about casting?"
Unidentified Analyst ,1,"Casting, casting, yes. "
Ramzi Hermiz,1,"So yes, when we look at it from a casting standpoint, a lot of activity on the casting front. That’s where we see that value. When I mentioned Clarksville and Nantong are both are launching new casting facilities, so that’s where one aluminum, one magnesium. So that is where you’re seeing a lot of activity. And back to your question of part numbers as well is, what you’ll also see is the value creation and one of the things in our -- for one of the programs, the prior version had 57-part numbers, we launched it, now we have 17-part numbers. It’s more the value that we are adding and it’s less about the number of part numbers. So, we still casting as a growth opportunity for us. But I don’t want anybody to walk away with the impression that steel is an opportunity. We are doing a lot of innovative things to lightweighting the steel front. With the high strength steel and some of the new alloys, Shiloh’s involvement on that front, they are -- they bring value. So, Shiloh’s multi-material approach of being able to manage in lightweight steel, aluminum and magnesium again is a clear differentiator in the marketplace. So, I know a lot of questions come about the casting side, what we’re doing in stamping and laser welding is really innovative, and we’re taking out weight there. And actually, there was, has been a question on some of the tariffs. But this, even with the higher, with the import tariffs and price of steel going up, this actually creates an additional opportunity for Shiloh, because we can take, we’re focused on gross weight as well as net weight. 
So, when a customer had a 10% increase in a door inner that’s a monolithic door with our laser welding technology. We can offset with value engineering, [value] analysis, we can offset that impact of, by taking out the gross weight. So again, I just, I kind of deviated from that just because I don’t want any, steel is not dead. Steel is going to have a part in a multi-material, multi-mix vehicle for sure. So, casting is an opportunity, for sure, magnesium structures, aluminum structures, fit as well as steel. "
Unidentified Analyst,1,"And then on China, the actual revenue generating date. Could you give us a target of when begins? And what you might expect to produce at the beginning and by late 2019? What’s your actual start date?"
Ramzi Hermiz,1,"Actual production is, we are, we’ll be, call it, September of this year will be start of production. Where we will begin a slow ramp. This is a new for what’s being launched in Nantong will be a new transmission for General Motors in that region to be doing their assembly. So, there will be a slower ramp if we would hit full volume by the end of 2019 for that transmission design. But at the same time, the team is working on some other new business opportunities and we feel very confident. As I answered on a previous question, on the growth opportunities within China. Not only for our aluminum business, but we’re there with mag already and with our Shiloh core dash panels that we’ve been there since late 2015. So, all the multiple products have opportunity."
Unidentified Analyst,1,"And then on this, the forward canceling of the F-150 production due to a production, parts production plant fire, which, I assume that, that has caused some reduced output on your part for parts for the F-150. Do you have thought on how this can get turned around in here?"
Ramzi Hermiz,1,"Well, the thermal event at the Meridian facility on May 2nd clearly was a disruption in the industry. And as somebody, who’s in the magnesium testing business, I mean, first thing, I would say is it’s great that nobody was injured in that event, because of the complexity. So that’s, first and foremost. The impact of the F-150, I mean it impacted 4 General Motors of BMW, Mercedes and FCA were all part of that facility. Overall, I would say it had a net, it will have a net neutral effect because of this reason. Yes, there was a stoppage in production and that, obviously, is impacting our, more of quarter three event for us than necessarily a quarter two. But at the same time, we were in a position to assist a few of those customers to get through their shutdown. 
So, I would say, it’s going to have a net neutral effect. What I would say, we did generate was with some of these customers, some extreme goodwill, because of our speed and ability to respond to help them get back into production or at least partial production. As you guys know, Mercedes and BMW are targeted for our Clarksville’s facility, which is a mag facility. And what Shiloh actually has is the next generation vehicle. So, what was in the other -- the Meridian plant was the old gen, we have the future products. So, we were able to, as I mentioned we’ve been accelerating our launch of the Clarksville facility. That’s in part response to make sure that we keep vehicles on the road for our customers. "
Unidentified Analyst ,1,"Okay. Thank you. And then one last one if I could. You did bring this up, this tariff situation that we are talking about now moved by President Trump. What’s the impact when you look at your Mexico operation and may be what conceivably you are going to be looking at in China? How do you -- do you see this as a neutral kind of situation or is it going to be a difficult barrier to get over?"
Ramzi Hermiz,1,"I am going to take a few minutes to answer this one George. The short answer I am going to say relatively neutral but in that it’s really you have to break it into three distinct discussions, China, Europe and NAFTA. China, we don’t import, export, really in either case. So, from the tariff debate that’s going on with China, I will say it has on the raw material a zero impact. Actually, the plus side of what’s going on and what some of the changes that China is doing is the reduction of import duties to 15% on vehicles imported into is actually has a potential to be a plus for us because most of those vehicles would be premium vehicles, which is where Shiloh participates in, in many cases from our European customers, GM, Volvo -- I am sorry, Volvo, JLR, BMW, Mercedes. So that could potentially be an upside win for us. The debate to move tariffs on EVs could be an upside win because of our North American customers as well as our European customers. So again, in our lightweighting and noise management products. 
So, the -- what’s going on in China actually has an opportunity to be a plus side. When you look at European position, you have the raw material side, I think overall while it’s creating a headwind, something over a period of time can clearly be mitigated for us. The question there will be a lot of our domestic OEM, our domestic -- the domestic facilities of our European customers who import or export their products, that could have an impact, the volume impact. So that’s where we are evaluating. It won’t have a raw material impact to us but it’s what’s their impact on the vehicle movement. 
Specific to NAFTA, part of the reason we restructured part of our restructuring plan was really moving products to Mexico or products that’s in Mexico to the US. So that activity has already started. I felt that Shiloh was extremely proactive in both setting the stage for what I will still say I am cautiously optimistic about ‘19. We are in a position with our restructuring plan to manage mix; one, to manage potential tariff disruption or the NAFTA disagreement or right now disagreement that we are in a position to do that; and three, our restructuring gives us the ability on the global scalable side. 
So, I think we can manage and we’ve put a number of actions in place starting last year that will position Shiloh in -- better than most who are still I think there’s a lot of people waiting on the sidelines to say we lacked when we know. We’ve acted with a flexible variable structure that we can accelerate or decelerate. And in my mind, we’ve actually accelerated some of our restructuring activity in part because of the mix shift and with the OEMs are obviously coming out and saying now they’re more purposely eliminating or canceling car programs, and so we’re accelerating our activity. So, we are going to be well positioned for ‘19."
Unidentified Analyst ,1,"And just in summation, it looks like the company you’ve brought it now to the point of where there is some -- could be some very, very positive acceleration and results for all the effort that has been accomplished over the last couple of years and the additional efforts that you had going now in the last 6 months to 9 months. So hopefully this will all come together as we move forward through the second half of this year. Thank you. "
Ramzi Hermiz,1,Thank you. We got a great team at Shiloh and they’re making it happen for sure. 
Operator,1,"Thank you. At this time, I’d like to turn the floor back to management for closing remarks. "
Ramzi Hermiz,1,"From my standpoint, really pleased with the progress Shiloh's making. We’re on track to our plan for 2018. As we look into 2019, I see a lot of the programs coming together, be it the restructuring, be it the acquisitions and integration, the product launches and really start seeing the 3 billion, nearly 3 billion of wins that we've had over the last 3-4 years, starting to roll into production and that’s exciting to see the teams, we got strong processes in place. It’s an exciting time, I think we’ve prepared ourselves for uncertainty. We’re taking what is considered uncertainty to try to create that as an opportunity and I think what we’re doing to position the business are the right things to do. We’ll have, if there is a downturn in ’19, we will have a smaller nimbler footprint that has a high degree of variability, in a sense of vulnerability and variability of cost structure that’s part of our restructuring efforts that again, will position us to move forward and again volumes not going to be our growth objective per se, on unit volume of vehicles. That’s not what’s going to drive our continued progress, it’s going to be that content per vehicle and that content per vehicle opportunity still remain and we’ll continue to right, remain. So, we have the right strategy at the right time, so we’re confident with that. So, thank you everyone. You have a great day and we’ll talk to you soon. Thank you. "
Operator,1,This concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.
