For those of you who are listening and viewing our webcast via the Internet, please take a look at Slide 2, net revenues. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, net revenues increased 84% to 449.7 million compared to 244 million in the prior year quarter. Acquisitions, net of divestitures occurring after the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, accounted for a 78% increase in revenues. Organic revenues increased 1% and foreign exchange rates, primarily driven by the appreciation of the euro, led to a 5% increase in revenues.
In addition, revenues for fiscal 2018 increased 41% to 1.3 billion compared to 923.3 million in the prior year. Acquisitions occurring after the beginning of fiscal 2017 accounted for a 35% increase in revenues, net of divestitures. Increased revenues globally led by North America contributed to an organic revenue increase of 4% and foreign exchange rates, primarily driven by the appreciation of the euro, led to a 2% increase in revenues year-over-year.
Please turn to Slide 3, gross profit margins. Core gross profit increased 65% or 35.1 million compared to the prior year quarter. Acquisitions occurring after the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 contributed 59% or 31.8 million to core gross profit, net of divestitures. Organic gross profit increased 2% or 1.1 million. The remaining increase of 4% or 2.2 million related to foreign exchange. Core gross margins were 20% of net revenues in the current year quarter compared to 22% in the prior year quarter.
Gross margins increased 28% or 55.7 million compared to fiscal 2017. Acquisitions occurring after the beginning of fiscal 2017 contributed 24% or 47.5 million to core gross profit, net of divestitures. Increased volumes and improved operating performance led to 4.8 million of organic margin improvement. The remaining 2% or 3.4 million related to foreign exchange. Core gross margins were 19% of net revenues for fiscal '18 compared to 21% for fiscal 2017.
Please turn to Slide 4, operating income and margins. Core operating income increased 64% to 20.6 million compared to the prior year quarter. Acquisitions occurring after the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, net of divestitures, increased core operating income by 57%. Non-core items in the current year quarter primarily related to inventory purchase accounting adjustments of 0.8 million, acquisition and integration expenses of 2.9 million, and facility closure expenses of 0.5 million.
Core SG&A increased 67% or 14.6 million compared to the prior year quarter. Acquisitions occurring after the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, net of divestitures, and unfavorable foreign exchange contributed 13.3 million and 0.9 million, respectively, to the increase.
Core SG&A as a percentage of sales were lower at 8.1% in the current year quarter as compared to the prior year quarter of 8.9% as a result of the Constantia Labels acquisition, partially offset by higher amortization expense. For fiscal 2018, core operating income increased 26% or 29.8 million compared to the prior year. Acquisitions occurring after the beginning of fiscal 2017 contributed 23.6 million to core operating income, net of divestitures.
For fiscal 2018, core SG&A increased 31% or 25.9 million compared to the prior year, including 23.9 million in relation to acquisitions occurring after the beginning of fiscal 2017. Unfavorable foreign exchange contributed 1.5 million to SG&A and the remaining 0.5 million increased primarily related to compensation expenses. Core SG&A decreased as a percentage of sales to 8.4% from 9.1% in the prior year.
Please turn to Slide 5, net income. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, core net income increased 38% or 6.4 million to 23.1 million compared to the prior year quarter. Core net income increased 14% or 8.4 million to 69.9 million compared to the prior year.
The effective tax rate on core net income was 30% for the quarter compared to 36% in the prior year quarter, primarily related to discrete items that reduced income tax expense in the current year quarter.
The core effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 26% compared to 31% in the prior year, primarily due to the adoption of new accounting standard to simplify share based payments, lower tax rates in the United States and other jurisdictions. The projected core effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 is 27%.
Please advance to Slide 6, core diluted earnings per share. Excluding the impact of non-core items, core EPS increased 14% to $1.12 per diluted share for the current year quarter. For fiscal 2018, core EPS increased 4% to $3.76 per diluted share from $3.61 in the prior year period.
Please turn to Slide 7, free cash flow. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 consisting of cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures was negative 0.8 million compared to 23.8 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to acquisition, structuring and related costs of 11 million, increased tax and other working capital requirements of 12 million and an increase in capital expenditures of 2 million.
Free cash flow for fiscal 2018 was a negative 3.2 million compared to 61 million in the prior year, primarily due to acquisition, structuring and related costs of 34 million, pre-acquisition financing costs of 5 million, tax payments and other working capital requirements of 11 million and an increase in capital expenditure of 14 million.
Please turn to Slide 8, core EBITDA. This slide shows core EBITDA for the quarter and the fiscal year. Core EBITDA is defined as core operating income plus depreciation and amortization. Core EBITDA increased 79% to 79.1 million in the current year quarter and core EBITDA increased 34% to 216.1 million for fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year.
Please advance to Slide 9, capital expenditures. Our fourth quarter capital expenditures were 16 million compared to 12.1 million in the prior year quarter. For fiscal 2018, our capital expenditures were 60.1 million compared to 46.1 million in the prior year. The projected amount of capital expenditures for fiscal 2019 is approximately 90 million.
Please turn to Slide 10, debt. Debt increased to 1.6 billion at March 31, 2018 compared to 482 million at March '17, primarily due to the acquisition of Constantia Labels Group. During the four quarters, the company has paid down 51 million in debt and borrowed, including acquired debt, of 1.2 [million] [ph] in relation to acquisitions. Net debt at March 31 was 1.5 billion.
Now, I'd like to turn the presentation over to Nigel."
Nigel Vinecombe,0,"Thank you, Sharon, and thanks for joining us. For us, we see the quarter and the year as mixed with positives from healthy 4% annual organic growth, stronger legacy gross margins in the second half of the year, acquisitions largely integrated and synergies on track for fiscal '19.
Negatives were primarily H1 legacy operation inefficiencies now behind us and H2 Constantia Labels acquisition earnings below expectations due to some operational inefficiencies particularly in the December quarter and those have improved in the March quarter.
We are optimistic about fiscal '19. We forecast organic growth continuing in the 3% to 5% range and we have a much more balanced revenue portfolio across key markets, geography and technology and more scale, as illustrated by Q4 being our first quarter with full acquisition activity in it coming in at 450 million in sales for the quarter.
In fiscal '19, we’re focused on the gross margin improvement. Gross margin of 20% for the March quarter is what we are seeking to maintain into fiscal '19, but not without its challenges. We need to improve gross margin performance to maintain 20% given that fiscal '18 acquisitions dilute gross margins for a full year in fiscal '19 and we do have some favorable FX in the March quarter just gone. This is a critical focus for us to push gross margin higher within the 19% to 20% range.
In the year with very limited acquisitions planned, we can maximize focus on organic growth, vetting in [ph] some exciting new CapEx initiatives seamlessly, better sharing, better practices across our Group and paying down debt. The last time we had this strong focus without acquisitions was in fiscal '15 and we saw a step change in earnings in that year. And with that, we forecast core EPS for fiscal '19 to be in the $4.20 to $4.50 range.
Happy to open it up for questions."
Operator,1,Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Your line is now open.
Ghansham Panjabi,1,"Nigel, Sharon, good morning."
Nigel Vinecombe,1,"Good morning, Ghansham."
Ghansham Panjabi,1,"Hi. So looking back at core sales growth on a quarterly basis for 2018; on a quarterly basis, you were up 1% in the first quarter, 6% in 2Q, 7% in 3Q and then sort of 1% in 4Q. In previous years, it was just much smoother. So what was so unique in 2018 in your view, Nigel, that drove that sort of volatility?"
Nigel Vinecombe,1,"I guess in Q4, Easter is the thing that springs to mind the most. Easter affected us fully in April last year and partially in March this year. And I think the first quarter of the year is also the timing of some holidays in Asia in particular from memory. So I think just the number of working days in the relative quarters nothing really stood out to us in terms of any specific trends. And as we noted, we had a very strong April. That gives us that 4% growth rate over the first four months of this calendar year."
Ghansham Panjabi,1,"And can you just touch on May just given what you called out in April relative to the first three months, what you’re seeing in May so far?"
Nigel Vinecombe,1,Nothing unusual.
Ghansham Panjabi,1,"Okay. And then last quarter you called out some production inefficiencies related to Constantia. Can you update us on that? I think the Belgium plant had some capacity constraints and also some performance issues in Mexico, et cetera?"
Nigel Vinecombe,1,"Yes, we called out those two areas and those have improved in the March quarter and we see ongoing improvement in FY '19. So for FY '19 we see that those will be behind us and good progress was made in the March quarter."
Ghansham Panjabi,1,Okay. And just one final one maybe for Sharon on working capital expectations for 2019. Thanks so much.
Sharon Birkett,1,"Yes, we’re not expecting the swings that we saw this quarter. There’s a number of things including the timing of tax payments. So I don’t think it’s going to have any material effect, so hence we’re still sticking with our 100 million in free cash flow projection."
Ghansham Panjabi,1,"Is it a source of cash for 2019, working capital?"
Sharon Birkett,1,"Net of tax payments, yes, but small."
Ghansham Panjabi,1,Okay. Thank you.
Operator,1,Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Mark Wilde,1,"Good morning, Nigel. Good morning, Sharon."
Nigel Vinecombe,1,"Good morning, Mark."
Mark Wilde,1,"Nigel, just as we kind of think about that 3% to 5% kind of organic growth target that you’ve laid out there for this year, is there anything that we should be aware of when we just think about sort of seasonality moving through '19 that would jump out at you?"
Nigel Vinecombe,1,"Nothing different in seasonality. If we look at our budget or our forecast for '19 by quarter, basically it shakes out that we have 26% of revenues in Q1, 24% of revenues in Q3 and 25% in the other two quarters, which is fairly consistent with the past ratios. So Q3 will continue to be the soft quarter for us."
Mark Wilde,1,"Okay, all right. And I know the focus this year is more kind of internal on delevering, but are there – is it likely that we’ll see some more smaller bolt-ons this year?"
Nigel Vinecombe,1,"We have a few very small things in the pipeline and one or two of those might come through in fiscal '19, but they will be very small in terms of scale. But we still have a healthy pipeline to keep warm and return to in following years based on '19 going according to expectations."
Mark Wilde,1,Okay. And then can you give us just some sense of kind of what you’re seeing kind of across your platform both in terms of kind of geographic strengths and weaknesses and also by business area?
Nigel Vinecombe,1,"Sure. I think that in terms of business area if we look at our growth, we’re seeing strong growth in developing markets and as we get more and more in there that’s going to help with our overall growth rate. We’re seeing a decent growth in North America, circa 4% in North America and we’re also seeing a couple of percent growth in Europe which has been healthy than it’s been in prior years. So fairly broadly based growth geographically. In terms of market segments, we’re seeing strong growth in Home & Personal Care and Wine & Spirits."
Mark Wilde,1,"Okay. All right, that sounds good. I’ll turn it over."
Nigel Vinecombe,1,Thanks.
Operator,1,Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.
Adam Josephson,1,"Nigel and Sharon, good morning."
Sharon Birkett,1,Good morning.
Nigel Vinecombe,1,"Good morning, Adam."
Adam Josephson,1,"Sharon, just a couple balance sheet questions then I’ll go to some other ones. Can you just help – remind us your pro forma leverage at quarter end?"
Sharon Birkett,1,In the 5x range.
Adam Josephson,1,Can you be any more specific?
Sharon Birkett,1,5x.
Adam Josephson,1,"Oh, it’s 5x, okay. And your free cash flow in '18 was slightly negative. I realize there were significant acquisition expenses in there. Was that in line with your expectations? I don’t remember you’re expecting negative free cash flow last year."
Sharon Birkett,1,"Yes, I think the acquisition expenses were in line with what we were anticipating and then – unfortunately there’s a whole load of other bits and pieces that we paid out that for example were part of the net debt deductions for purchase price but essentially come along in the balance sheet and we pay them after closing. So the number’s slightly bigger in terms of the way that it flushes out but not bigger versus what we expected to pay."
Adam Josephson,1,"Okay. A couple other ones. Your FX, can you remind us or help us with what your pro forma FX translation exposure is now?"
Sharon Birkett,1,"At the end of the day there’s some large numbers there but it really has a minimal impact, some circa 800,000 in the quarter, 1.2 for the year. So it’s still – once it comes down to the net income line, it’s still a very small delta in terms of the translation impacts which were positive for the year."
Adam Josephson,1,Right. And how big is your Brazil exposure at this point?
Sharon Birkett,1,Nonexistent.
Nigel Vinecombe,1,Minimal.
Adam Josephson,1,"It’s minimal, okay. And then you mentioned the end markets and you called out I think Home & Personal Care and Wine & Spirits being particularly good. Can you just talk a little about Food & Beverage? Obviously you bought Constantia for greater Food & Beverage exposure. Obviously that business has some pretty sizable big beer exposure. So can you just help us with what you’re seeing in Constantia’s end markets?"
Nigel Vinecombe,1,"Yes, there’s some growth opportunities, a bit constrained by some capacity. So a lot of our CapEx this year is tailored towards taking some of the technologies that we have in some regions to newer regions to open up the growth opportunities we see in Food & Beverage that we haven’t quite been able to get out as much as we would like to-date. So we see that being a good growth area for us as that CapEx comes on stream during the course of this year."
Adam Josephson,1,"Okay. And just in terms of your guidance, the $4.20 to $4.50, correct me if I’m wrong but last time you talked about expecting $0.40 to $0.50 of accretion from Constantia in fiscal '19. So that would get you to call it the $4.25 ballpark. So you’re expecting just a little bit of organic growth in '19. Correct me if I’m wrong there."
Nigel Vinecombe,1,"We’re expecting organic growth in that 3% to 5% range, so if you want to build a bridge from 3.76 to somewhere in the midpoint of the range we’ve given, yes, you need to add in some organic growth and you need to add in the $0.40 to $0.50 that we spoke about for Constantia. But we also did not expect or didn’t model an extra circa $0.30 a year for extra amortization of intangibles related to Constantia over and above what we modeled. So, yes, we need to put organic growth in there and that’s a healthy number but you need to also take out the extra amortization, so they don’t quite net each other out. But you sort of need to take both into account not just the growth."
Adam Josephson,1,"So in other words, you were expecting $0.40 to $0.50 of accretion before and now it’s more like $0.15."
Nigel Vinecombe,1,"It’s more like – yes, $0.15 to $0.20, yes."
Adam Josephson,1,"$0.15 to $0.20, okay."
Nigel Vinecombe,1,In the first year.
Adam Josephson,1,"Sorry, go ahead, Nigel."
Nigel Vinecombe,1,"Yes, in the first year."
Adam Josephson,1,"Okay, got it. Thank you."
Operator,1,Thank you. Our next question comes from Roger Spitz with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Roger Spitz,1,Thank you and good morning. What is your normalized CapEx post the fiscal 2019 guidance which was 90 million?
Sharon Birkett,1,"I think we still would stick with our range of 4% to 5% of sales which is the higher end of the range this year as we were last year, because we’ve seen the organic growth. So 5% is a good run rate for us."
Roger Spitz,1,That’s all. Thank you.
Operator,1,Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from David Stratton with Great Lakes Review. Your line is now open.
David Stratton,1,Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions.
Nigel Vinecombe,1,Good morning.
David Stratton,1,"When you talked about your gross margin improvement that you’re going to work for in 1Q and throughout the rest of the year, can you give a little color around how you intend to achieve those margin improvements, whether it’s just synergy realization with Constantia or if you have other internal initiatives? And what do you expect the pace to look like as we move through fiscal '19?"
Nigel Vinecombe,1,"Yes. So as we mentioned, so our starting point if you like in the first full quarter is circa 20% for the March quarter and so that does have Constantia in there for the full quarter. So we think that we can target maintaining that but we do have to get some operational improvements along the way and we think that they will come from across the business through the normal course of improving our best practices and reducing inefficiencies from where they are today. So nothing specific but we do have per plant targeted projects for improvements."
David Stratton,1,"All right. And then to kind of piggyback on the previous question of margins. When we look at fiscal '19, I think you were pretty clear about the puts and takes. But going out, has anything changed as far as how you see cost synergies or maybe even revenue synergies playing out as you get more insight into the business and operations start to merge together?"
Nigel Vinecombe,1,"As we mentioned, the cost synergies are on track for '19. And as far as '20 is concerned, we’re confident at this stage that we’ll get those synergies. So we’ll do at least as well as we had planned in terms of synergies from acquisitions in '18. In terms of revenue synergies, they take longer but we do see some positive projects already developing that will help us in terms of strong organic growth than we otherwise would have had. So they’re more difficult to quantify but we certainly see projects in the pipeline that will deliver us benefits in that regard."
David Stratton,1,"Great. And then one last one regarding the debt pay down. I think you previously said you hope to get down to around 4x within three to four years. Is that still the schedule? And if not, any update would be helpful?"
Nigel Vinecombe,1,"Sure. Look, I think we use most of our free cash flow for debt in fiscal '19, then we should get into the mid-4s range. And if we use most of it in – similarly in fiscal '20, we should get down to circa 4 within [indiscernible] in other words."
David Stratton,1,"All right, thank you."
Operator,1,Thank you. And we do have a follow-up question from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Adam Josephson,1,"Thanks, Nigel. Just one more on just the amortization. Can you just help me understand why the amortization was so much greater than what you initially expected?"
Sharon Birkett,1,Sure. So the external valuations have placed the higher portion of the purchase price on the customer which does get amortized versus the goodwill which does not.
Adam Josephson,1,"Okay. If I go back to the – your initial presentation, i.e. you guided to $0.40 to $0.50 of accretion by fiscal '19 and $0.80 to $1.00 by fiscal '20. So it is reasonable to assume that both numbers have come down by that same $0.30 or should I think about that any differently than that?"
Sharon Birkett,1,"No, that’s the correct way of thinking about the amortization."
Adam Josephson,1,"Okay, fair enough. Thank you."
Operator,1,Thank you. I’m not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Nigel Vinecombe for any further remarks.
Nigel Vinecombe,1,Thank you. Thank you for your time and your questions today. We’re excited about getting into fiscal '19. There’s strong opportunities for us in both the revenue terms and gross margin terms and we’re looking forward to delivering on the promise as a result of the larger group that we now have. Thanks for your time.
Operator,1,"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude today’s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."
