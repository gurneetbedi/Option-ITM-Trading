Operator,0,"Good morning. My name is Denise. I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the George Weston Limited Third Quarter Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Geoff Wilson, you may begin your conference."
Geoff Wilson,0,"Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to the George Weston Limited 2018 third quarter conference call. I'm joined here this morning by Galen Weston, Chairman and CEO; Richard Dufresne, President and CFO; and Luc Mongeau, President of Weston Foods.
Before we begin today's call, I want to remind you that the discussion will include forward-looking statements, such as the Company's beliefs and expectations regarding certain aspects of its financial performance in 2018 and future years. These statements are based on certain assumptions and reflect management's current expectations, and they are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from current expectations. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in the company's materials filed with the Canadian Securities Regulators including the Company's third quarter news release. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. The Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Other than as required by law, certain non-GAAP financial measures may be discussed and are referred to today. Please refer to our third quarter news release and other materials filed with the Canadian Securities regulators for reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. An archive of this conference call will be available on our website. Loblaw Companies Limited released its second quarter results last week, and therefore, we will focus this call on the performance of our Weston Foods segment.
I would now like to introduce Richard."
Richard Dufresne,0,"Thank you Geoff, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we released our third quarter results for George Weston Limited. On November 1st, we completed the Choice Properties spin out to George Weston Limited. We are pleased with the outcome of this transaction. The company is now much better positioned for the future with a simple structure, enhanced cash flow, strong balance sheet and therefore more optionality for growth. 
For the third quarter, George Weston Limited reported adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $2.25 compared to $2.14 for the same period in 2017, an increase of 5.1%. In the third quarter of 2018, Weston Foods sales totaled $630 million, a decline of $38 million over the same period of 2017. Sales decreased mainly due to the impact of product rationalization, and the loss of business from key customers. Weston Foods' adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2018 was $72 million, a decrease of $8 million compared to the same period in 2017. Excluding the impact of $14 million real estate gain, the decline in adjusted EBITDA was driven by the decline in sales and higher input and distribution costs, partially offset by benefits realized from the transformation program, net of costs and productivity improvements.
For the full year 2018 Weston Foods expects sales to trend in a similar fashion to the first half of 2018 when compared to last year. Sales are expected to be negatively impacted by volume declines including the loss of sales from key customers, and the continued effect of product rationalization. Excluding the net gain on sale of property, adjusted EBITDA will trend in a similar fashion to the first half of 2018. Adjusted EBITDA will be impacted by sales trend, headwinds from higher input and distribution costs in an inflationary environment and minimum wage increases, partially offset by improvements from the transformation program and productivity.
Investments in capital expenditures will decrease to approximately $215 million for 2018 compared to $230 million as previously stated. And finally, depreciation will increase compared to last year as we continue to invest in our business.
I would now like to turn over to call to Galen."
Galen Weston,0,"Thank you, Richard and good morning. Before turning to Weston Foods, I'd like to comment on both the successful spin out of Choice Properties and the strong third quarter results that Loblaw released last week. Amid continued headwinds Loblaw remained focused on its commitment to stable trading, delivering value to customers and in turn growing both traffic and basket size. We saw improvements and promotional effectiveness and further benefited from the strength of our loyalty program PC optimum. Loblaw's strategy continues to create momentum as data-driven insights and process and efficiency initiatives allow us to make additional investments for the future.
At the same time, the successful spin out of Choice Properties is another significant milestone that positions our company for the long-term. Choice Properties maintains its strategic operating relationship with Loblaw and George Weston is now a stronger company with three distinct and complimentary pillars that provide growth and flexibility for the future. With the spin-out complete, I'm also pleased to announce a 5.1% increase in George Weston's quarterly dividend to shareholders.
At Weston Foods, we continued to underperform against our expectations. We are one year into an ambitious plan and it has had mixed results. Although, we remain optimistic about the business's future, we have taken decisive action to slowdown the transformation program and are carefully managing the pace of change so that management can focus on the top line. While the program has improved our ability to manage costs and to simplify the business, not all the benefits have flowed to the bottom line. We have fallen short on customer service that has adversely impacted our sale. Put simply, we are not yet operating at the high standard that we expect of ourselves.
Looking forward, we remain committed to our strategy and encouraged by several positive things which are happening. Business fundamentals are improving with less waste, more productivity and a better ability to forecast our results. We are also seeing sales momentum in key growth areas such as artisan and pre fried doughnuts. While recent performance continues to be disappointing, we are confident that management is focused on the right areas to position Weston Foods for the future.
I'd now like to open the call to questions."
Operator,1,"[Operator Instructions]
Your first question comes from Irene Nattel with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open."
Irene Nattel,1,"Thanks and good morning, everyone. Would you be able to elaborate on the ways in which you are slowing the process? How you plan on building momentum and top-line? And really what the implications are for the timeline and the magnitude of the lift in EBITDA that you laid out when you first embarked on the transformation plan?"
Luc Mongeau,1,Yes. We're slowing the program in the areas where there's impact on customers. So first thing we're doing we're slowing down the implementation of our ERP SAP program. We're slowing down as well; we're reducing the number of SKUs that we are discontinuing by about 20%. We're reducing as well the amount of CapEx that we are investing in the business to allow us to do what Galen refer to which is a really bringing stabilization to the business. And significantly improve our service level. So we can return the entire business to growth.
Richard Dufresne,1,"Yes, Irene, it's Richard. In terms of the timing for the business to stabilize, our focus right now is fully on the stabilization of our business, and we're focusing on minimizing the impact on customers. Focus is clearly shifting to execution and sales momentum and as we get traction with that we'll be able to comment further on that."
Irene Nattel,1,That's very helpful. So but just think --presumably some of the lost volume however has gone to other players. How challenging do you think it's going to be to essentially pull it back over to your side?
Richard Dufresne,1,We're still having good traction and discussion with customers. So it's an area that we're focused on more and as to some of the business we lost like will have to lap that business for another four quarters because one of the business we lost was at the beginning of Q3. So it'll take us a few quarters to lap that business.
Irene Nattel,1,And what was the magnitude of the one that was lost in Q3?
Richard Dufresne,1,"Sorry, Irene, we're not going to give that number."
Irene Nattel,1,"Okay and just one final question if I may. Now that you have simplified the structure and strengthened the cash flow, can you walk us through what the plans are for George Weston Limited or what the thinking is for George Weston Limited over the next let's call it two to five years?"
Richard Dufresne,1,"Okay. So we just closed the transaction. Actually we didn't have that party yet. So joking aside, actually like actually that's reality. We have not really started to work on specifically what we want to do next, but as we've mentioned earlier, we're going to be looking at businesses that have some adjacencies with the existing businesses we have. We like businesses that have organic growth. We like businesses that generate cash flow. We like businesses that are sound and we want to maintain a strong balance sheet. So those are sort of broad criteria that we will use in sort of selecting opportunity that we want to look at. But we're really at the beginning of it and so there's nothing to report on that for the moment."
Operator,1,Your next question comes from Jim Durran with Barclays. Your line is open.
Jim Durran,1,"Yes. I just wanted to stay on the fourth pillar. So is that a change then in terms of where you're at in that process? Not a change obviously in terms of strategic parameters that you're pursuing, but I was sort of under the understanding we might see something happening sooner than what you're maybe suggesting in a loose fashion."
Richard Dufresne,1,"No, not really, no change, no change like we're like the first step I guess the first step was to complete the spin out. It's just been completed. So we wanted to make sure that was done and well done and we're happy with the outcome as we mentioned. So now we'll start to do the work, but it's going to require a lot of work to figure out what else what next we want to do."
Jim Durran,1,"And Richard when you talk about this being sort of a George Weston component, is it possible that Loblaw might be the recipient of that spend and would just by ownership have a benefit to George Weston in totality or do you see the fourth pillar as definitively residing within George Weston?"
Richard Dufresne,1,"Like everything is on the table. Like we're looking at all of our businesses. We're looking at businesses that are adjacent to our existing businesses, and we need to find something that works for the group that is priced right and ultimately that will create value for all of our shareholders."
Jim Durran,1,"Yes. And then on the pricing front, we've heard commentary from The Canadian grocers holistically that there's a slight uptick in inflation as manufacturers have been requesting price increases to offset costs pressure. Are you seeing any of that in the bakery business at this point? And is it the same US versus Canada or some differences there?"
Richard Dufresne,1,We are definitely seeing cost increases in our input costs as we mentioned in our comments in this quarters results. And we're always in discussions with customers as to ways to mitigate those.
Jim Durran,1,And so no pricing action so far?
Richard Dufresne,1,"There are no pricing actions in our outlook for the rest of 2018, no. "
Operator,1,Your next question comes from Patricia Baker with Scotiabank. Your line is open.
Patricia Baker,1,"A number of questions. First of all, with the decision to slow the pace of change am I right in assuming that that will impact when you will achieve your targeted synergies and that puts that out a bit further?"
Richard Dufresne,1,"Yes, Patricia."
Patricia Baker,1,"Okay and then secondly with respect to slowing the SKU, lowering the SKUs so that you'll do 20% less than you originally intended. So does that mean what's the actual number of SKUs that will be taken out in 2018?"
Luc Mongeau,1,"The original plan was to discontinue about a 1,000 SKU. So we'll bring this --the 20% we'll bring this down to about 800. Otherwise we are on plan to achieve our target of this discontinuation."
Patricia Baker,1,"Okay, thank you. And then I think it was you Galen you mentioned that Weston Foods fell short on customer service in Q3 and specifically what --how did -- how was --did that manifest itself? You weren't able to get the product to the customer on time or exactly where did you fall short?"
Luc Mongeau,1,Yes. The program created some disruption with customers and it's mainly as you described service levels that prevented us to give either quality or quantity of what our customers required to grow.
Patricia Baker,1,Okay and my final question is a bigger one. So you're one year into what was as you called it a very ambitious three-year turnaround plan. When you look back after the first year what would you have done differently?
Luc Mongeau,1,"We're inspired by the where the program is going. So on one hand the program is doing extremely very well. In areas of productivity, reduction of waste, improvement of downtime, we're seeing very promising signal. In the areas of cost containment, we're seeing very good results as well. And as the same thing in our simplification our business. We've got a business structure that's much simpler than it was before allowing us to take faster decision and better decision. As mentioned earlier, the program does created disruption with customer service, service levels and our aggressive SKU discontinuation, unfortunately impact, negatively impacted customers. And that's why we're taking the decision to slow down the pace of the program. Slowing down in the areas where there are direct customer impacts to allow us to return the business are the top line of the business back to growth."
Richard Dufresne,1,"Yes. The only thing I would add, Patricia, is we're committed with the strategy like we feel we have the right strategy. And so it's just going to take a little bit longer than we expected."
Operator,1,Your next question comes from the line of Mark Petrie with CIBC. Your line is open.
Mark Petrie,1,"Good morning. Luc, just with regards to the slowing of the SKU rationalization. Also you guys have been closing some facilities. Can you just update us in terms of how you're thinking about the manufacturing footprint over the next couple of years?"
Luc Mongeau,1,"Yes. At this point, we're really focused on stabilizing the business, improving our service level and returning the top line to growth."
Mark Petrie,1,"Okay and with regards to the ERP SAP implementation, where are we at with that and what's the sort of timeline for sort of full effectiveness from that?"
Luc Mongeau,1,Now we're still in the initial phases of the program. And we've got a time horizon of about three years for full implementation.
Galen Weston,1,"We were essentially going to, it's Galen, we were essentially going to deploy the first stage of ERP in one of our businesses, and specifically our artisan business and we just put that on pause. And I think the way to think about this is we have a good plan, a good strategy. We took on too much, not any one thing caused all of this friction. It was really trying to do all of these things at the same time, and so now we're slowing them down. We're not giving up on the full SKU reduction. We're just saying the pause; let's make sure that we build back the business in the right places.
Let's pause on SAP; even the best implementations of an ERP are disruptive. Why take on that incremental disruption at the moment, and when it comes to the plant footprint, there's friction every time you shift production from one facility to another facility. And so we're just putting that on pause. Once we have the sales going in the right direction again, and once we're delivering the quality and the customer service at the level we expect, we will wrap all of those things up. And on that basis we still keep that financial target in our minds. It's just as Richard said going to be pushed out somewhat."
Mark Petrie,1,"Okay. That's helpful, thank you. And then just I guess one question just with regards to the performance in Q3 specifically with regards to the EBITDA margin compression. Wonder if you could just sort of maybe out a high-level kind of help us how much of that is just sort of deleveraging from the top-line decline? How much of it is the challenge in passing? The cost pressures that you're facing and how much of it would you sort of say is the execution with regards to service levels?"
Richard Dufresne,1,"Okay. So let me try to give you some guidance now. Essentially when you look at the income statement, obviously, Law sales has affected the bottom line but like more specifically there was a loss in fresh business. And as you know, that's one of our highest margin businesses, so that affected gross margin. We had --we are experiencing more inflation year-over-year in essentially most input costs in flour, packaging, eggs so that is also --that is affecting the gross margin.
Actually if you look at SG&A and if you exclude the gain on real estate, it's actually flat last year. So it shows that we've been able to manage our costs quite effectively. So as we gain momentum on sales again that will help mitigate that. But that's how we're sort of looking at it from a financial perspective and that's why we feel that if we get the sales going, it will help a lot to fix our financial problems."
Operator,1,Your next question comes from Peter Sklar with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Peter Sklar,1,"If you look now at your broader strategy for Weston, you have really four assets. You have interest in Loblaw, Choice, the bakery plus, all this cash. It sounds like overtime; you're going to acquire additional businesses in adjacent categories. So my question, Richard, is like how does Weston create value through these acquisitions versus these businesses continuing to -- if you were not acquired then they are going to operate on their own. It sounds like you're not going to buy another grocer and recall the benefit from all of the associated synergies, it sounds like you're going to be buying businesses in adjacent categories where it's uncertain what the -- I mean, I'm sure, there'll be some benefits, but uncertain just what the synergies would be. So where is the value creation coming from?"
Galen Weston,1,"It's Galen. I'll let Richard answer the question on value creation, but just a little bit of context so that you're thinking about this the same way that we are. So we're in the retail business, supermarket business in Canada. We're in the bakery business and we're in the real estate business. And we look at the potential to create value not exclusively by adding a fourth pillar, but also looking at areas to scale up or increase investment. So Loblaw, we already kind of did that with Shoppers Drug Mart. You saw us do that with the acquisition of CREIT in the real estate business.
So we're not saying that there aren't incremental opportunities over time in those areas, but it stands to reason that our priorities will be looking at what types of opportunities there might be in the bakery business. And that is conditional upon us stabilizing the existing financial performance. And the second is, are there some adjacent --is there an adjacent third or fourth leg that we can add value to. And Richard can comment on how we see ourselves adding value. You're clearly right. There are not the obvious financial synergies that would come with a transaction like that. So we need to think carefully about how to create value."
Richard Dufresne,1,"Peter, if you look at all the strategic moves we made over the last like five six years like I would argue that all of them have been value enhancing to the group. And so that's how we're looking at things. So, yes, if we look at a wholly separate pillar where there are no synergies is going to be tougher, but like we won't contemplate doing something that's not going to be creating value long-term for our shoulders. That's always how we've been looking at things. Even if you look at the spin out like you look at how Loblaw is trading now like that that's actually positive element of actually just reorganizing our asset.
So, therefore, we always have that lens that we're focused on whatever we do and as Gal mentioned like we may end up adding to what we already we have. So but we're just keeping all options open. And we don't have anything ready to announce that's in our back pocket. No, we're starting to do the work now."
Peter Sklar,1,"And if you do ultimately acquire the fourth leg or the fourth asset, and that acquisition is successful, could you contemplate down the road that there could be a fifth or sixth just what are your long-term intentions?"
Richard Dufresne,1,I -- anyway that my opinion. I don't think it'd be a fifth and a sixth. And if we have a fourth then maybe we don't stay at four. We could be shrinking back to three. So it's like --we don't have a definite plan to we want four or three or two businesses. We want to look at opportunities which going to create value for shareholders. That's what we care about. And I think we try to articulate it as well as we could by doing the spin-off. By creating a better investment thesis in George and we want to improve on that investment thesis. So that's how we're looking at it.
Operator,1,Your next question comes from Irene Nattel with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Irene Nattel,1,"Thanks. Just continuing this conversation, thank you very much for the last statement because I guess if we go back part of what we're thinking is, well, this part of this is about addressing the asymmetric balance of value at GWL, but if you create more value within say Loblaw or CREIT that doesn't get to that objective. So should we be thinking about it about whatever you do next as creating value in totality or creating value in GWL separate from CREIT and Loblaw?"
Richard Dufresne,1,"Ultimately, Irene, if our businesses value goes up George Weston goes up. So that's like simple math. So that will be taking into consideration as we look at other alternatives because we can always look at what we have, and that is definitely a filter that we are using when we're having those discussions. "
Galen Weston,1,"I think the message that we're trying to communicate here and I know people would love to have more information and at the right the right time obviously we will provide that is that want to be strategic and we want to be financially disciplined. And we're not pursuing strategies simply because they're historical or simply because we want balance. Our priority number one is to buy well and well means a good trajectory to creating shareholder value. And as such the opportunities could be anywhere across our portfolio. Having said that, we just did a big deal in the real estate business. We have a strategy that's very focused on digital organic growth at Loblaw. And so the priorities are in the two places that I mentioned earlier."
Operator,1,"There are no further questions. And at this time, I turn the call back over to presenters."
Richard Dufresne,1,Great. Thank you very much for joining us today. Our 2018 fourth quarter release is scheduled for February 27. Thank you very much joining this morning. Have a good day. Bye- bye. 
Operator,1,This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.
