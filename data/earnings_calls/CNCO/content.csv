I would now like to turn the call over to Rodrigo Larrain. Mr. Larrain, the floor is yours."
Rodrigo Larrain,0,"Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your participation in our quarterly conference call. In summary, we delivered solid results for the quarter, including an increase of 7% in EBITDA, reaching a 7.6% margin in first quarter 2018. Good performance was primarily driven by improved activity and profitability in Argentina, specifically Home Improvement and Financial Services, Colombia EBITDA margin improvement, while Chile's profitability remained stable. The positive results were in spite of currency depreciations against the Chilean peso, and the good operating results did not entirely flow through to the bottom line due to lower profit from exchange differences.
Before getting into the specific results for the quarter, I want to take a step back to underscore an important event that took place after the quarter ended. On May 9th, we announced the agreement to sell a 51% stake in Banco Cencosud Peru to Scotiabank, a great step that will allow us to continue growing the business and servicing our customers through this joint venture while focusing our resources in our core retail and real estate operations. This is also a step forward in our commitment to strengthen our financial position and our $1 billion noncore asset sales plan.
We anticipate proceeds from this sale to be $100 million, which will be used to reduce debt. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals in both Peru and Canada. Although we have no control on the timing of approvals, we expect the transaction to close during the second half of this year. Coming back to the first quarter results. Our performance highlights our leadership's team commitment to the successful execution of our long-term strategic pillars. I will now discuss our progress against our strategic initiatives. So with that, as context, let me start with profitability.
Turning to Slide number 3. Consolidated revenue was down 4%, impacted by currency effects, as I just mentioned. But on a constant currency basis, we're up 7%. Some notable drivers include higher revenue in most of the Chilean operations. Home Improvement and Financial Services were key drivers behind a solid performance in Argentina, and we are encouraged by an acceleration in same-store sales at Supermarkets. Peru benefited from a double-digit increase in same-store sales in Department Stores as well as one additional store.
We made progress in our productivity and cost-savings initiatives, driving strong margin expansion as we were able to generate better expense leverage. Margins also benefited from an increased portion of higher margin from imported products in the mix. As a result, adjusted EBITDA was up 7% in the quarter, 20% in a constant currency basis and the margin expanded by 77 basis points.
Continuing with our strategic pillars, please turn to Slide 4, as I provide an update about our omni-channel initiatives. We continue to strengthen and enhance our e-commerce capabilities. Online will continue to be complementary to our stores, as this gives our customers many convenient shopping options. Let me bring you an update by countries, starting with Chile. A key accomplishment in the quarter was increased geographical coverage of our 90 minute delivery service, reaching a total of 14 communes in Santiago. Our e-commerce platform has gone live at Johnson Department Stores. We're seeing stronger consumer response to online apparel sales at Paris stores, up 600 basis points due to greater focus on this category to drive profitability and improve customer experience.
A few other items by other countries worth pointing out. In Peru, 12 stores in Lima have Click & Collect and four provide drive-thru service. We now have nationwide coverage for nonfood products via Wong and Metro. Finally, in Colombia, with addition of 12 more Jumbo stores that offer online shopping, we now cover 88% of the cities, where we have a Jumbo store.
Looking at our performance by business segment on Slide 5. Revenue growth in Chilean pesos remained soft in Supermarkets in all countries except Chile, mainly reflecting currency depreciation in all countries and food deflation in Brazil and Peru. Partially offsetting this was a benefit from the Easter shift into first quarter this year. On a constant currency basis, supermarket sales were up a healthy 5% year-over-year. EBITDA was down reflecting increased promotional activity, a lower supplier rebates across the region as we more closely manage our inventory purchases.
Across the region, our Home Improvement stores all benefited from higher sales of imported products, partly offset by weaker sales of summer related products due to cooler summer temperatures. EBITDA benefited from increased percentage of higher margin, imported products in the mix and better SG&A expense management, including lower employee and other services-related cost.
Department Stores reported flat revenue, affected by a high comparison basis and higher promotional activity year-over-year. And Shopping Center improved 349 basis points in EBITDA margin. Finally, our Financial Services business, similar to past quarters, delivered the strongest growth for both revenue and EBITDA. This good performance was due to growth in the loan portfolio and additional product offerings.
Now I will turn the call over to Marisol to discuss our business by segment. Marisol?"
Marisol Fernández,0,"Thank you, Rodrigo, and thank you all for joining us today. Moving on to our discussion of our individual business units starting with Supermarkets, our largest business on Slide 6. Same-store sales grew above inflation in Chile, Brazil and Peru. And sales also benefited from the positive impact of the Easter calendar effect.
In Chile, revenues rose over 5% in our competitive environment with a strong promotional activity, while we are seeing lower manufacturing costs, rapid productivity from our Santa Isabel bakery and headcount efficiencies. Adjusted EBITDA was almost flat year-on-year, impacted by an increase in logistic cost and higher advertising expenses.
In Argentina, inputs remained a strong differentiation factor driving revenue growth. This was further supported by a good performance in nonfood sales despite increased competition from the informal market. Our strong focus on cost controls and efficiency is yielding good results, driving higher profitability and adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. In Brazil, sales were impacted by food deflation and the closing of 11 stores. Despite these headwinds, we posted a sequential improvement in same-store sales traffic and gaining market share.
By brand, Bretas achieved the first positive same-store sales since the first quarter 2014, Prezunic continued to show a positive same-store sales trend and GBarbosa posted a second consecutive quarter with positive same-store sales. Adjusted EBITDA in turn was impacted by gross margin contraction due to lower rebates from suppliers, partially offset by better operating leverage. In Peru, we posted a positive same-store sales despite store remodeling and food deflation. Additionally, for the Metro brand, we're taking a more target approach to advertising and working to change the price perception of our brand. While our efficiency initiatives resulted in lower expenses, our strategy to reduce inventory purchases resulted in lower supplier rebates and negatively impacted profitability. Lastly, in Colombia, revenue was impacted by the net closure of three stores. Strong competition from hard-discounters, lower food inflation and a weak customer environment. Lower rebates from suppliers and greater promotional activity in turn more benefit cost efficiencies resulting in a contraction in adjusted EBITDA margin.
Moving on to Home Improvement on Slide 7. Revenue fell slightly over 2% impacted by currency depreciation in Argentina and Colombia, while adjusted EBITDA margin expanded over 220 basis points. By country, Chile posted stable revenue as a good performance in imported products. Wholesale and e-commerce was offset by slow demand in the summer categories from colder weather year-on-year. We are very pleased with the 45% improvement in adjusted EBITDA and a 297 basis point margin expansion. In addition to lower cost and expenses from our efficiency projects, this was also due to the year-ago quarter [indiscernible] was impacted by a onetime loss related to the fire of our distribution center for online purchases.
Argentina posted same-store sales above inflation, reflecting a higher share of imported products. This also benefited margins, which along with greater expense leverage growth of 187 basis points EBITDA margin increase in the quarter. Finally, Colombia posted the second consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales, driving by higher sales of soft categories, wholesale and e-commerce. Efficient expense control along with greater operating leverage dilution resulted in adjusted EBITDA margin expansion.
Moving on to the Slide number 8 department Store revenue was up 0.5% in the quarter, although adjusted EBITDA declined almost 32% during the quarter. In Chile, we continued to enhance our customer shopping experience, driving 45% growth in e-commerce. However, lower purchases from Argentine tourists crossing over to Chile and a weaker back-to-school season resulted in a decline of almost 3% in revenues. Increase of promotional activity along with higher share of e-commerce sales and security expenses also contributed to lower adjusted EBITDA. By contrast, they do deliver double-digit revenue growth driven by robust same-store sales and a net opening of one store. Lower promotional activity and efficient inventory management together with greater operating leverage resulted in increased profitability during the quarter.
Now I will discuss Shopping Centers on Slide number 9. Total segment revenues were flat year-on-year impacted by currency depreciation, but up almost 10% in local currency driven by growth across all countries, while adjusted EBITDA increased 5% during the quarter. Chile posted adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of over 500 basis points reflecting the contribution of new stores to Costanera Center, higher revenues from Sky Costanera, lower severance and advertising expenses as well as easier comps from the reversal of the recognition of property taxes.
Profitability margin in Peru was improved driven by higher operating leverage. By contrast, adjusted EBITDA margin contracted in Argentina, impacted by salary adjustment and higher legal costs and, in Colombia, reflecting lower cost dilution.
Lastly, Financial Services. Please turn to Slide 10. Financial Services remain our top-performing business unit with revenue increase almost 19%, reflecting a strong portfolio growth across all countries of operations, while adjusted EBITDA was up 46%.
Now by country. Chile reported adjusted EBITDA growth of 40%, driven by the solid performance of our joint venture, loan portfolio growth of 23% and continued cost efficiencies. Revenue growth in Argentina was driven by portfolio expansion. Adjusted EBITDA was up over 50% at expense leverage more than offset higher risk charges. Brazil also achieved higher adjusted EBITDA driven by lower risk charges and funding cost along with continued cost control. By contrast, profitability declined in Peru and Colombia as a result of higher risk charges, while Colombia was also impacted by a onetime write-off. These more than offset improved cost dilution in both countries.
I will now turn the call back to Rodrigo to discuss our financial position. Rodrigo?"
Rodrigo Larrain,0,"Thank you, Marisol. And moving on to Slide 11 as I discuss our balance sheet. Total net debt at quarter end was $4.6 billion compared to $4.4 billion in first quarter '17. This slight increase was mainly due to lower other current financial assets, where we hold the mark-to-market of derivatives and cash.
In turn, net debt to adjusted EBITDA in first quarter 2018 was 3.86 times compared to 3.5 in first quarter '17. We maintained our commitment to our investment-grade rating and to driving the net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA below 3x on a sustainable basis. We will accomplish this as demand recovers and our strategic initiatives continue to deliver EBITDA growth. This will also be supported by the $1 billion noncore asset sales program, which is underway.
Please turn to Slide 12 for closing commentary. Today, our business is well positioned. Our performance in the quarter reflects ongoing successful execution of our key strategic pillars and the quarter figures validates our long-term strategic plan and demonstrates the progress we continue to make in executing that plan to profitably grow. So in summary, we remain careful in our expense and capital management to deliver consistent financial performance while positioning the business to succeed for years to come. We're committed to continue strengthening our financial position and our moving ahead in our noncore asset sales plan.
Thank you for your time and interest. I would now like to open the call to questions."
Operator,1,[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Antonio Gonzalez from Credit Suisse.
Antonio Anaya,1,"So I wanted to ask first on Argentina. Is there any color you can give us on recent results starting in the second quarter? Have you seen any deterioration as the quarter has progressed compared to the first quarter? And how are you working to mitigate the currency risk from here in Argentina, specifically? And then, I have a short follow-up question."
Rodrigo Larrain,1,"Till now, we have not seen any impacts in terms of consumption or same-store sales. The trend has pretty much continued as seen in the first part of the year. The most immediate impact in our results will definitely be in the translation from Argentine pesos to Chilean pesos when we consolidate our financial results probably in the next quarter. But so far, we haven't seen an impact in consumption. If interest rates at 40% plus levels should remain for a long period of time, we might definitely start to face some deterioration in terms of consumption.
In terms of our balance sheet in Argentina, we have a loan portfolio in the credit card business that adapts to the new conditions. And in terms of our local debt, we have a really small portion of our debt is denominated in Argentinian pesos. In terms of hedging, we have requested quotes for hedging Argentina to dollars. These hedges are not deep in terms of or not performing in terms of amounts and length and are very expensive. So something that we are analyzing, but for the time being, we have not decided to take currency risks hedge."
Antonio Anaya,1,"Okay. Rodrigo, and if I may just quick follow-up. It seems like you have lower purchases of inventory across countries in your Supermarket division, particularly. So I wanted to ask if you can remind us whether there is a target on how many days you can improve your inventory turns or may be absolute dollar amount that you want to create in working capital efficiencies? Any way you can help us quantify these? And also as a result of this strategy, are you concerned that all that -- maybe fill rates could decline if you have much stricter inventory policies going forward? Or any upcoming impact to same-store sales that you could foresee as a result of this strategy?"
Rodrigo Larrain,1,"Yes. Antonio, definitely, we have been focusing for the last several quarters on efficiencies across the board. And one of the targets that we have been working on with the teams is efficiencies on working capital and inventory in particular. We believe that we still in some operations have higher base of inventory and excess of inventory, and we can reach a healthier level without affecting fill rates and availability. And what we see in the short term perhaps impact in -- for kind of a onetime is that by lowering the level of purchases with suppliers, we have in those quarters lower rebates compared to the year before."
Operator,1,Our next question comes from the line of Nicolas Larrain from JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
Nicolas Larrain,1,"On Chile, first of all, I wanted to see if you could help us quantify the positive effect of the Easter seasonality, especially in Supermarkets, I would say, so that we can better analyze how sort of organic trends are going? And also super quick on Brazil, if you could give an update on how are you seeing numbers for the second Q even though the recent strikes in the country and probably supply issues are for the Supermarkets?"
Rodrigo Larrain,1,"Sure. We'll start with the current issue and events that's evolving in Brazil regarding the road blocking and paralyzation from the transportation sector. So far and fortunately, I think the stores were well positioned in terms of inventories to face the first base of this event. So up to now, all stores continued to operate, but we're starting to face some unavailability in some categories. So the potential impact will definitely depend on how long the situation continues.
As you all know, it's a situation that's affecting, I would say, the country and the economy as a whole, and it's in the top priority of the government to resolve this issue. And so far, the impacts have not been any material in terms of our operations, but if it lasts, we'll have some effects. On the other side or on the flip side is that we are being able to reduce our stocks. We haven't had to be that aggressive in terms of promotions. But again, any effect will depend on how long this situation lasts."
Marisol Fernández,1,"Nicolas, regarding your question about Chile, could you please repeat it? We could not quite understand clear."
Nicolas Larrain,1,"So I was asking if you could help us quantify the positive effect that the Easter seasonality had on Supermarkets, specifically?"
Marisol Fernández,1,"Yes, on average, Easter adds another 200 basis points on same-store sales."
Operator,1,[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Antonio Hernández from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Antonio Hernández,1,"My question is on Department Stores in Chile. You said that adjusted EBITDA was affected from promotional activity, higher share of e-commerce. Do you have any breakdown of how much of the impact comes from these two factors? And what should we expect going forward, especially as e-commerce sales are expected, I guess, to have a higher share of retail sales?"
Marisol Fernández,1,"Yes, basically, in the case of Department Stores, as we mentioned on the press release, we faced lower summer temperatures. Remember that last year, there was a very high temperatures. The increased promotional activity are lower purchases from foreign consumers crossing over Chile, Argentine are acquiring less bucks in the case of Chile. But in contrast, we have seen a significant improvement in the online channel, which online sales are growing more than 40% year-on-year.
And we expect this positive trend to continue as we keep enhancing our omni-channel capabilities and improving customer experience. So far, we still are facing the weather situation. I don't know if you are aware, but we are facing the driest autumn over the last 50 years in the case of Chile. So that is something that continues, and we are seeing also our continuous promotional activities that we've seen in the first quarter."
Operator,1,Our next question comes from the line of Alonso Aramburú from BTG. Please proceed with your question.
Alonso Aramburú,1,I have one question going back to potentially Argentina. Have you had any delay in the sale of some of your noncore assets because of the volatility in the country? And how are you seeing the potential to announce some of the sales that you were expecting to have as part of these sale of noncore assets?
Rodrigo Larrain,1,"Well, first, as you know, we will be announcing once deals are closed. And second, I would reinforce that we'll continue working and making progress in a number of alternatives, and the leverage continues to be a top priority for the board and the senior management. In the case of Argentina given the recent situation, any particular asset sale in that country could face some delay.
But in any case, the portfolio under which we're working on, you could consider several of different assets. So we're not dependent on any specific negotiation. And so we will make announcements once things are closed like we did with the recent one in Peru. And we continue to estimate the same time frame which -- to complete this process, which was between 12 to 18 months since we announced it in late August."
Operator,1,"[Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time, and I would like to turn the call back to Rodrigo for closing remarks."
Rodrigo Larrain,1,"Okay, thank you all very much for your questions and your attention today, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. In the interim, the team remains available to meet with you and answer any questions you may have. Have a good day."
Operator,1,This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.
