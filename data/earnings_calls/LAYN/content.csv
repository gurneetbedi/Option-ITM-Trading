It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Ken Dennard. Mr. Dennard. Please go ahead."
Ken Dennard,0,"Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for the 2019 fiscal first quarter earnings conference call for Layne Christensen. Our speakers today will be Mike Caliel, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Anderson, Chief Financial Officer.
Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone that remarks today will include forward-looking statements. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to the several factors, which can cause actual results or events to differ materially from those that we anticipate due to a number of risks and uncertainties. For a summary of risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday’s press release and the section of Layne’s fiscal year 2018 Form 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements in addition to other documents as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not intend to update these forward-looking statements and undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements, except to the extent required by law.
During today’s call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from or substitute for our GAAP results. You can find definitions of our non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to their nearest GAAP measures in yesterday’s earnings release and on our website.
Before I turn the call to Mike, please be aware that we will not be taking any questions about the proposed merger with Granite. And I encourage you to refer to our public disclosure regarding this transaction. Including our final proxy statement letter to shareholders that we filed on May 15th, if you have any questions. A special meeting for approving the proposed transaction is scheduled for June 13th.
Now, with that said and behind me, I’d like to turn the call over to Mike Caliel. Mike?"
Mike Caliel,0,"Great. Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.
I’ll begin by providing some of the key highlights of our first quarter performance then of course Michael will provide more of a detailed review of our financial results. So, let me start by saying our first quarter results were improved over the prior year and they were in line with our expectations. Our overall financial performance reflected a 3.3% increase in revenues, led by improvements in Mineral Services and Inliner and that more than offset a 5% decline in revenues at Water Resources. And we made improvements in Water Resources profitability that came through our restructuring efforts, which are designed to reduce our costs and enhance our job margins. And sequentially, we managed to further reduce our unallocated corporate expenses.
So, for the first quarter, we reported $12.6 million of adjusted EBITDA and that compared to $9 million in adjusted EBITDA on last year’s first quarter. The increase in adjusted EBITDA compared to last year was led mainly by improved performance in our core Water Resources businesses, water well drilling, and repair and installation work. And we generated net income of $2.7 million for the quarter that was helped by gains on asset sales that have been part of the Water Resources restructuring efforts.
Inliner revenues increased 3.9% and adjusted EBITDA increased 5.5%. That was led by strong operating performance, despite the adverse effects from a number of winter storms in the Midwest and the northeastern U.S. that reduced revenue modestly during the quarter. About $1 million of the revenue increase was driven by higher levels of subcontracted work.
In Mineral Services, revenues were up 17.9% during the first quarter compared to the prior year period. And that was due to increased drilling activity, primarily in the western U.S. and Brazil. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was down slightly compared to prior year period. That was due to reduced dividends from our Latin America affiliate and to a lesser extent the delays on two customer jobs in Mexico that we discussed during our fourth quarter call. And the job delays in Mexico were resolved late in the first quarter. And we expect a pickup in revenues in Mexico in Q2.
In Water Resources, first quarter revenues declined 5%, due largely to several office closures, and that’s part of our restructuring efforts, and also lower collector well activity. Adjusted EBITDA increased by more than $4 million as we benefited from improved job execution and the positive impact of our business improvement initiatives in terms of cost reductions and also facility rationalizations. During the quarter, we also benefited from the performance of the Water Midstream business that as you know wasn’t operational in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and the Hermosa pipeline asset in particular, And Michael will provide some additional details on the Water Midstream business during his comments.
Now, with respect market highlights for the quarter. We are seeing relatively stable market conditions in most of our business lines as we are moving into the more active summer months. And as it relates to Water Resources, we expect to continue to benefit from the cost reductions and the restructuring programs that we implemented over the course of the last year and a half. With lower precipitation levels I should say over the winter, particularly in the west, we have seen initial signs of increased drilling activity in the agricultural markets, balancing that, though we are experiencing lower agricultural drilling activity in the Midwest and the Northeast portions of the country related to higher than normal precipitation levels. We also expect the Water Midstream business to benefit from good industry conditions in the Permian basin and a full-year of operations on our Hermosa the system. And while we have not yet had water sales on GLO lands, we expect revenue impact from GLO late in the second quarter or early in the third quarter of this fiscal year.
Inliner continues to experience relatively good industry growth opportunities, but labor markets remain tight, making it costlier and more challenging to launch new cruise and meet our organic growth expectations. And the minerals market continues to reflect some encouraging signs with increased activity in the western U.S. Although we have seen moderating commodity prices in the last quarter, particularly for copper and gold where gold prices are up about 3% year-over-year and copper is up about 21% year-over-year. Although both commodities are down a bit versus the first part of April at the time of our last earnings call.
In minerals, our fleet utilization remained relatively flat at around 50%. At these utilization levels, we continue to see limited opportunities for any meaningful improvement in pricing.
So, with that, let me turn the call over to Michael to review our first quarter results in a bit more detail."
Michael Anderson,0,"Thanks very much, Mike, and thanks, everybody, for joining the call this morning. I’m sure that you’ve been able to note that we filed the press release, along with our 10-Q with the SEC yesterday. So, those of course are available to you for the call and for additional details. First of all, I’ll go through the first quarter overall performance and then will discuss the divisional regional results in more detail. 
So, as Mike had mentioned, we had improved year-over-year results. Consolidated revenues were up 3% year-over-year to a $115 million in Q1; adjusted EBITDA for the quarter of $12.6 million compared to $9 million a year ago. The improvement was driven primarily by Water Resources which generated $4.5 million in EBITDA during the quarter compared to just $250,000 in EBITDA in last year’s first quarter. Most of the Water Resources improvement, as Mike had mentioned, occurred in our core water well drilling and repair business where we had both improved job margins and reduced SG&A. We reported positive net income from continuing operations in the first quarter of $2.9 million, and that’s about $0.14 per share compared to a net loss of $4 million or $0.20 per share in the first quarter of last year.
Net income was favorably impacted by about $4.6 million in gains on asset sales that’s primarily owned with real estate and also some older equipment within our Water Resources division. And this was partially offset by restructuring expenses, largely related to our pending merger with Granite.
Unallocated corporate SG&A expense during the quarter was $4.8 million that compares to $4 million in last year’s first quarter and $5.2 million in the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter. The increase from the prior year period was due primarily to favorable reserve adjustments that we had a year ago, sequentially the SG&A was down by about $400,000 versus Q4. Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter increased slightly to $6.8 million versus $6.5 million a year ago.
Looking little bit more detail -- in more detail the divisional performance, we’ll first of all start with Inliner. First quarter revenues were up about 4% year-over-year to $49 million; that’s reflecting an increase in activity levels in some of our UV liner work and also a higher level of subcontracted work. Inliner generated $8.2 million in adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter that compares to 7.7 a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA margins for both periods were steady at 17% of revenues.
The early part of this year’s first quarter at Inliner did feel the impact of adverse weather conditions, particularly in the Midwest and the Northeast where much of our work is actually performed. We had about $2 million in decreased revenues associated with the winter storms during the quarter due to work delays. Backlog at the end of Q1 was a $122 million that compares to $131 million we had at the end of January.
Moving onto Mineral Services. First quarter revenues were $26 million and they were driven by improved activity levels in the western U.S. Project delays that we talked about in the Mexico that affected fourth quarter performance, also impacted the early part of Q1 but they are now behind us. And we’re seeing the incremental contributions from new business coming from gold and copper mining, primarily in the western United States. Adjusted EBITDA for Mineral Services in the first quarter was $4.8 million that compares to $5 million a year ago, and the slight decrease was due to the timing of affiliate dividends which were actually down $0.5 million on a year-over-year basis.
Moving over to Water Resources. Our first quarter revenues decreased to $40 million compared to $42 million in the prior year’s first quarter. The $2 million decline in revenues was related to our office closings and downsizings as part of our restructuring. And also, we had some lower drilling activity in our collector well unit. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.5 million, with the benefits of our business performance initiatives and also improved project execution. The division also benefited from the incremental contribution from the Water Midstream business. During the quarter, the Hermosa pipeline generated $1.3 million of EBITDA in the quarter that’s steady with Q4. We continue to see ongoing drilling and completions activity in the Delaware basin and expect to see growing volumes in the coming quarters associated with higher rig counts.
Our business development activities at Water Midstream added about $700,000 of expense to SG&A. And over the course of the year, we do expect to benefit from our SG&A investment in Water Midstream business and development to grow our activity levels at Hermosa, at GLO and also in other areas.
On the GLO front, we’ve recently drilled six water wells on some acreage in the western part of Reeves County and we completed two water storage ponds with 1 million barrels of water storage capacity. Total CapEx for the development of this GLO acreage thus far has been a little bit under $5 million. And while we’ve not signed any term contracts to-date near this acreage, we are certainly working hard with producers who need completions water in the area and we continue to expect to generate water sales from this acreage in the next couple of months. They’re very good opportunities with 68 operating rigs within three miles of GLO acreage, but we do need to invest in water infrastructure to actually be able to create the opportunities to win water business with producers in those areas.
Let’s look now overall at liquidity for Layne. At the end of the first quarter, we had a cash balance of $18 million that gives us $93 million of liquidity, combined with availability under our revolver. At the end of the quarter, we had nothing drawn on that revolver.
I want to cover a little bit more about the capital structure a bit as well. As we had previously disclosed, we executed new loan commitment in late March that was to refinance our upcoming $70 million of 4.25% note maturities. Those come due in November of this year. We still, however, have the debt maturity of our 8% notes and also our ABL facility. Those are coming due within the next 12 months. And as such, we have added some additional language and disclosure in our 10-Q regarding our liquidity position going forward.
So, as we mentioned at the top of this call, we are not going to be taking any questions on the proposed merger with Granite. We certainly direct you to our public disclosures regarding the transaction, including our recently filed proxy statement.
And with that said, we will be happy to entertain questions on our first quarter results. So, operator, with that, please open the line."
