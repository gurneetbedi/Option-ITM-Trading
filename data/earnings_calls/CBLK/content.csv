Patrick Morley,0,"Great, thanks Mark and thanks to everyone for joining us today on our first quarterly earnings call as a public company, and we're very excited to have completed our successful IPO in May which we believe is an important milestone in positioning Carbon Black to become one of world's leading security platforms.
Carbon Black's mission is to transform security through Big Data and analytics in the cloud. The Carbon Black Predictive Security Cloud platform introduces the highly differentiated set of technologies that are disrupting the legacy antivirus market, and the PSC puts us in a great position to expand into adjacent security markets.
Enterprise customers currently have on average over 70 different security vendors and are looking for ways to consolidate on the platforms and reduce their vendor list. We are very confident that our unfiltered data and the power of our Predictive Security Cloud positions us to be one of the ultimate platform winners in security.
Our first quarter financials reflect a strategy that is working with strong results. We generated revenue of $48.4 million, representing 35% growth year-over-year. Cloud revenue was $11.7 million representing 195% year-over-year growth. And we ended the first quarter with 4006 total customers, including 1870 cloud customers.
Since this is our first earnings call as a public company, I would like to take a few minutes to give an overview of our technology, our market opportunity, and our go–to-market model before I review our first quarter highlights.
Carbon Black's founding team was trained as offensive hackers by the NSA and CIA. That experience gave them the fundamental insight that the only way to see and stop the adversary is to collect the most complete data and apply the best analytics to that data. Based on that insight, our founding team created the Endpoint Detection and Response or EDR market by developing unique technology to capture unfiltered endpoint data. You can think of our technology as a surveillance camera that continuously records everything happening on an endpoint. It is the foundation of our approach and it's highly differentiated in the market.
We believe our approach is the best way for organizations to protect themselves in today's IT environments, in which network security is increasingly insufficient. Endpoint devices represent the new perimeter that must be protected. Endpoints include laptops, servers, virtual machines, ATMs, gas pumps, point-of-sale systems, and the control systems that run factories and power grids and anything else that carries a workload. Endpoint devices contain the critical data, intellectual property, and business processes that attackers want to get at.
In this new paradigm, legacy antivirus products face two big limitations which render them ineffective against an increasing array of attacks. First, legacy AV products focus on prevention only. So once an attack gets through, those products do not collect data to track what the attacker does next on that endpoint.
Secondly, legacy AV products can only detect previously recognized malware making them ineffective against attacks which have never been seen before, like last year's massive WannaCry and NotPetya attacks. Carbon Black's approach is to leverage the power of our unique, unfiltered data and advanced analytics to provide a full security lifecycle; that is to prevent, detect, and respond to current attacks and to predict future attacks. We see this approach resonate in the market as a growing number of organizations around the world are replacing legacy AV with our Predictive Security Cloud platform to improve their overall security.
To deliver our unique approach to security, we made three key technology breakthroughs. The first breakthrough is the collection of unfiltered endpoint data that I mentioned earlier. You can think of this as the digital equivalent of a surveillance camera on each endpoint. Just like a surveillance camera in a convenience store, our surveillance camera is recording everything on the endpoint whether or not we think something bad is happening. This is very different than the approach that legacy AV products take, which is to collect data only when they know something is bad.
It is also very different to the approach of other newer endpoint security vendors who collect data only when they think something might be bad. This difference is critically important because today's attackers increasingly use trusted software and third party services to compromise endpoints and steal data. We believe the only way to effectively combat attackers is to record everything, whether we think it is bad or not so that we can see and stop both known and unknown attacks.
Our second breakthrough is our proprietary Data Shaping technology. It seems obvious that unfiltered data is something every security vendor would want to collect, but it's hard to do in a cost effective way. Carbon Black has spent nearly a decade developing our proprietary Data Shaping technology, which solves what is called the edge to cloud data pipelining problem and makes unfiltered data feasible. This means we can move vast amounts of data we collect to the cloud and store and analyze that data for a variety of use cases in a cost effective manner. We believe this is a sustainable, long-term competitive advantage.
Finally, to fully leverage the power of unfiltered data, our third breakthrough is a new approach to endpoint data analytics that focuses on behavior over time. We call this streaming analytics, which is based on event stream processing technology which has revolutionalized other industries such as high frequency trading and credit card fraud detection. Our fundamental insight with streaming analytics is to focus on activity in a set of files or discrete moments in time. This enables us to detect and prevent malicious activity, regardless of whether the attack is old or new, uses files, or stays in memory, or leverages trusted software.
We initially brought our big data and analytics platform to the market as an on-prem offering. This included Cb Protection, our market leading application control product to lockdown data center servers and critical infrastructure and included Cb Response, our market-leading threat hunting and incident response product for security operations teams.
Two years ago we began moving out core differentiators on to a scalable, multitenant cloud platform on which we could deliver additional capabilities to our customers. Our cloud platform, the Predictive Security Cloud collects unfiltered endpoint data once and solves multiple IT and security challenges through a single agent, single console and single data set.
Cb Defense is our flagship product on the Predictive Security Cloud. Cb Defense provides integrated next-generation antivirus or NGAV along with Endpoint Detection and Response or EDR. It is designed to replace legacy AV in squarely IT and security teams. The PSC allows us to quickly deliver new offerings to customers on one platform, again leveraging one agent, one console, and one data set.
Last December we added Cb ThreatSight which is our managed alert triage services that leverages Cb Defense to help understaffed security teams prioritize the most threatening alerts in their environment. Cb ThreatSight is a compelling add-on for many customers and it allows our sales team to easily show the value of our cloud-based platform approach.
In Q1 of this year we released Cb Defense for VMware. This product is the foundation of an exclusive partnership with VMware that brings server administrators a new level of security for their software defined data center. This is an exciting Greenfield opportunity as VMware has 500,000 customers running 60 million VMs or virtual machines of which only a small percentage have a dedicated endpoint security product installed. We developed this product together with VMware and have joint go-to-market efforts underway.
Over the next year we plan to add three additional products to the Predictive Security Cloud platform, Cb LiveOps which provides IT and security teams the ability to query the current state of their enterprise endpoints in real-time, Cb Workloads which allows IT and security staff to secure their cloud native workloads in Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, and Cb Response which brings our flagship industry leading on-prem threat hunting and incident response product to the Predictive Security Cloud.
From a market size perspective our success so far has been focused on disrupting the $6.5 billion enterprise endpoint security market. This market alone provides a significant runway for growth in the coming years. We think there is an even broader opportunity to leverage our Predictive Security Cloud platform to solve multiple IT and security challenges which expands our overall TAM to $19 billion.
From a go-to-market perspective we engage in extensive network of channel partners who work in conjunction with our inside sales, field sales, and customer success teams globally to create significant long-term leverage for our business last year we closed over 90% of our business in collaboration with partners. Our customers range from SMBs to 33 of the Fortune 100. We work with three types of partners. First, we work with large distributors such as CDW and Arrow. Secondly, we work with Managed Security Service Providers or MSSPs and incident response firms, organizations like SecureWorks and Kroll who use our solutions as part of their offerings.
We are the vendor of choice for IR firms who use our products in 374 incident response engagements in 2017. Lastly, we have a strong and growing ecosystem of technology partners who leverage our open APIs to integrate with our products and access our unfiltered data. This includes strategic partnerships with VMware which I mentioned earlier and with IBMs $2 billion security business unit giving us access to their 17,000 customers. Both of these companies did a thorough evaluation of the market before choosing to partner with Carbon Black.
That concludes my overview of Carbon Black. Let me now turn back and discuss first quarter results in a bit more detail.
We had a strong quarter across the board that reflected exciting new customer wins as well as good up-sell activity. We hit an important milestone in the quarter as bookings from cloud products represented more than 50% of our new and add on bookings for the first time. This is powerful customer validation of the predictive security cloud and the latest example of the substantial growth opportunities ahead for our cloud product platform.
We are particularly excited about the continued strong traction of Cb Defense which is our flagship product on the Predictive Security Cloud. It replaces legacy AV. New and add on Cb Defense deals in Q1 span a broad range of industries with significant transactions in healthcare, technology, business services, electronics and government. Major Cb Defense wins included one of the world's most iconic and sophisticated e-commerce companies as well as leading global logistics company that licensed Cb Defense to replace our legacy AV product on 27,000 endpoints.
We saw strong initial uptake of Cb ThreatSight, our managed triage service on the Predictive Security Cloud. Cb ThreatSight is an easy add-on to include Cb Defense deals and we see this strategy gaining significant traction.
We are also pleased with our international growth. We closed our first large Cb Defense transaction in Asia-Pacific with a large electronics hardware manufacturer who replaced its legacy AV with our NexGen solution on 50,000 endpoints. We also saw large transactions in the Middle East and Europe with wins at leading global oil company and major healthcare provider respectively.
In addition to strong traction of Cb Defense in the Predictive Security Cloud, we saw a balance of business across our entire product folio including Cb protection and Cb response. Those products drove new and add-on deals with a wide range of customers including for example a top 10 global automotive manufacturer, a leading financial services company, a major branch of the U.S. Military and one of the world's biggest pharmaceutical companies.
Finally, we saw continued strength in our partner eco symptom in Q1, increasing partner traction with the Predictive Security Cloud. In addition to the launching Cb Defense for VMware we also expanded our relationship IBM Security with the Predictive Security Cloud now a part of IBM's X-Force Threat Management services and the addition of new integrations between Cb Defense and IBM Securities' QRadar and BigFix products.
To summarize, Carbon Black started 2018 on a strong note. We are gaining substantial market traction with Cb Defense and our Predictive Security Cloud. Our pace of innovation has never been greater and we're closing significant customer wins around the globe across our entire product portfolio. We believe we are in an excellent position to build one of the leading next generation security platforms and we're incredibly excited about the company's future.
With that, I'd now like to turn it over to our CFO, Mark Sullivan."
Mark Sullivan,0,"Thank you, Patrick. Before viewing details of our first quarter financial performance and providing our outlook for the second quarter and remainder of the year, I'd like to review our financial model since this is our first earnings call. Also I wanted to remind everyone upfront that given the timing of our IPO after the end of the first quarter, we already presented capsule results for the first quarter in our S1 for revenue and profitability. So today's announcement is largely providing additional details around the direction already provided. 
With that, we generate the vast majority of our revenue by selling subscription arrangements for both our cloud and on-premise products. Our contracts typically have a one or three-year term and are generally priced on a per endpoint basis. We sell a small amount of perpetual licenses generally to customers who originally purchased from us on that basis. Substantially, all customers who purchase perpetual licenses also purchase maintenance and support agreements as well as an agreement that provides access to the threat intelligence capabilities of the Carbon Black security cloud.
We implemented ASC 606 as of January 1, 2018. So our first quarter results reflect the new revenue accounting standard. We utilized the full retrospective method and overall there is an immaterial impact to revenue recognitions. In 2017 told new under ASC 605 was $162 million and under ASC 606 last year's total revenue was $160.8 million.
All of our product related revenue will continue to be recognized on a ratable basis under 606 including the small amount of perpetual business we sell. Perpetual revenue will be recognized over the course of the expected five-year customer life under 606. Since all of our product related revenue which was 89% of total revenue in 2017 on a 606 basis is recognized ratably we have a high level of revenue visibility. 
Our one-year subscription contracts of annual upfront payment terms and prior to 2017, our multiyear contracts also had annual payment terms. Accordingly, billings and cash collection occur ahead of revenue recognition. During 2017 we invoiced the full amount of new multiyear contracts on an upfront basis at the request of our channel partners. This led to an increase in long-term deferred revenue as the entire contract value was booked to deferred revenue.
At the beginning of 2018 we moved back to annual payment terms on multiyear agreements in order to optimize long-term commitments to our [indiscernible]. You'll see the impact of these invoicing changes by comparing the respective growth rates of total versus short-term billings. Total billings grew faster in 2017 up 48% year-over-year compared to 37% growth in short-term billings. As we move back to annual payment terms on multiyear agreements in 2018 we expect that short-term billings will grow faster than total billings as long-term deferred will no longer benefit to the degree we sign multiyear agreements. This upfront multiyear invoicing practice in 2017 also benefited free cash flow by approximately $10 million which will not reoccur this year.
Now let me turn to our first quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $48.4 million, up 35% year-over-year. Subscription, license, and support revenue was $45.4 million up 38% year-over-year and services revenue was $3 million, up 4% year-over-year. Recurring revenue which includes license, subscription, and support revenue, but excludes perpetual revenue was $43.8 million, up 39% year-over-year and represented 90% of total revenue.
We also focus on annual recurring revenue or ARR and short term billings as indicators of our business momentum. We calculate short term billings as the sum of total revenue plus the change in short term deferred revenue which eliminates the impact of upfront multi-year payments. ARR at the end of the first quarter was $182.8 million up 37% year-over-year. Short term billings were $42 million, up 35% year-over-year.
Growing our customer base is a key priority for the company. During the first quarter we grew our customer base by 267 customers bringing our total customer count to 4006, this is up from 2,648 in the year ago period and 3,739 at the end of last quarter. The number of customers who have deployed at least one cloud product was 1,870 at the end of the first quarter compared to 552 in the year ago period and 1,605 at the end of last quarter. Please note that existing on-premise customers who subsequently purchase the cloud product are included in the cloud customer account and the cloud customers may also have on-premise solutions as well.
In the first quarter our gross retention rate which we calculate by comparing the annual recurring subscription and support revenue from our customers in the current quarter with the annual recurring subscription and support revenue from those same customers at the end of the first quarter of 2017 was greater than 90%. Please note that this retention rate calculation does not take into account the impact of any up sell activity.
Moving down the P&L, please note that I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the first quarter was $38.7 million representing a gross margin of 80%. While gross margin was flat year-over-year we anticipate gross margins to decrease modestly over time due to our rapidly growing mix of cloud business and the associated hosting and infrastructure cost of delivering cloud products. Sales and marketing expense was $29.7 million, an increase of 27% year-over-year and represented 61% of revenue down from 65% of revenue in the year ago period.
Investing in our go-to-market organization in order to improve our market coverage and position the company to generate sustained strong growth over the long term is our primary area of investment and we generate strong returns on our sales and marketing investments. If you look at our 2015 new customer cohort, we generated a payback period of a little over a year and a contribution margin of greater than 70% on the customer cohort in years two and three. Q1 sales and marketing expense reflects our decision to reallocate some variable marketing spend to later in the year which is taken into consideration in the guidance I'll share in a moment.
R&D expense was $14.3 million, an increase of 31% year-over-year representing 30% of revenue in line with the year ago period. As Patrick highlighted, we are making significant investments in our product portfolio as we build out our offerings on the PSC. G&A expense was $5.8 million or 12% of revenue which was consistent with the year ago period. Our operating loss was $11.1 million or negative 23% operating margin for the first quarter compared to a negative 28% margin in the year ago period.
Net loss in the first quarter was $11 million or $0.98 per share based on $11.3 million weighted average shares outstanding. On a GAAP basis gross profit was $38.2 million operating loss was $17.8 million and net loss was $20.6 million. Net loss attributable to common stockholders was $60.6 million or $5.38 per share. Net loss attributable to common stockholders includes $40 million of non-cash accretion of preferred stock. The preferred stock converted to common as part of the IPO. In addition, in the quarter we incurred a $3.9 million expense related to a litigation settlement. We will pay the $3.9 million over the remainder of 2018.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with $33.7 million in cash and no debt. Subsequent to the end of the quarter we closed our initial public offering on May 8, which generated proceeds net of underwriting discounts and commissions of $162.6 million. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was negative $800,000 after taking into consideration $1.8 million in capital expenditures, free cash flow is negative $2.6 million in the quarter.
I’d now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2018. Beginning with the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $48.5 million to $49 million, non-GAAP loss from operations is expected to be in the range of $18 million to $17.5 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $0.42 to $0.41 based on $43.6 million weighted average shares outstanding.
For the full year 2018 we expect revenue to be in the range of $203 million to $204.5 million which equates to 27% growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP loss from operations is expected to be in the range of $63.5 million to $62 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of a $1.35 to a $1.32 per share based on $47.4 million weighted average shares outstanding. A reminder, that these results are on a 606 basis including comparisons to prior periods.
To conclude, Carbon Black delivered strong first quarter results. Our differentiated product portfolio is resonating with customers and we are seeing the positive impact of our investments in sales, marketing, and R&D. We're in the early stages of growth in the next gen antivirus market and we see an even bigger opportunity over time to leverage our unfiltered data to disrupt other security categories.
With that, we’d like to open it up to questions. Operator?"
Operator,1,Thank you Sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Melissa Franchi with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Melissa Franchi,1,"Thank you, and congrats on the quarter. Patrick, it seems like you're seeing a lot of good traction with Cb Defense, so I'm just wondering if you can talk about the extent to which you are deploying Cb Defense is starting to rep [ph] in place of legacy endpoint or is it still coming in as a kind of secondary functionality? And then what are you seeing in terms of pricing behavior amongst your competitors particularly around some of the legacy vendors?"
Patrick Morley,1,"Yes, hi Melissa, thanks for the question, and the team on the go-to-market side is leading with Cb Defense and it's the primary product on the Predictive Security Cloud, it's our lead product there. And the majority of wins that we're seeing with Cb Defense in the marketplace are AV takeouts, so that's a rip and replace where we're actually replacing traditional providers in that marketplace.
When you look at the capabilities of a next-gen AV such as Cb Defense, with that offering we're providing capabilities both around preventative capabilities but also EVR like capabilities that provide customers with a lot of perspective on what's occurring inside their environment on specific endpoints.
And so, to actually protect the environment because they can do the full life cycle prevention, detection, response, and prediction is much, much greater. And because of that, what we're seeing is that on the pricing side we've been able to maintain the pricing levels we’ve had historically even against competitors, some of the traditional providers, who in some cases are pricing less than us and what customers are seeing in the value of our solution allows us to do that and we've been able to maintain that."
Melissa Franchi,1,"Great, and just one follow up on cross-selling, I'm wondering if you can talk about the new Cb Defense customers if they're coming in and also buying additional products like Cb Protection or Cb Response or is that opportunity still kind of Omnicom?"
Patrick Morley,1,"Yes, so Cb Response and Cb Protection, I think about those as the on-prem offerings and on the Predictive Security Cloud today we have Cb Defense, and in Q, at the end of Q4 we introduced Cb ThreatSight which is the alert monitoring triage service that we have, and so you can think of that exactly the way you’ve ask the question as is a cross-sell or an up-sell opportunity for that offering.
We introduced that at the end of the Q4, the first quarter up-selling was Q1 was Cb ThreatSight, and we were very pleased with what we saw for customers making the decision to buy both Cb Defense and Cb ThreatSight at the time of purchase. In addition, we saw some add-on sales of that product back into the base of Cb Defense. In addition, in Q1, we introduced Cb Defense for VMware, again another service on the Predictive Security Cloud introduced in Q1 and we anticipate that in Q2 we'll start to see the same type of cross-sell opportunities with Cb Defense for VMware.
And the reason for that is typically you introduce it in a quarter and the next quarter is when from the sales enablement, a channel enablement, you start to see the momentum behind that service, the new service."
Melissa Franchi,1,"Got it, thank you."
Patrick Morley,1,Thanks Melissa.
Operator,1,Thank you and our next question will come from the line of Sterling Auty with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.
Sterling Auty,1,"Yes, thanks. Hi guys. Can I ask the kind of the competitive question a little bit different, each one of the vendors that are out there, both the new vendors and the legacy have strengths in different kind of forms and fashion, some are better in endpoint protection, others are better in EDR with the service layered on top of it. So when you look at the volume of business in the quarter, how much of what you were doing was being brought in because of your strength in EDR where you're being layered with another solution versus going completely with Carbon Black with Cb Defense as the all-in endpoint solution?"
Michael Viscuso,1,"Yes, thanks Sterling. This is Mike Viscuso. As Patrick walked through our differentiators of unfiltered data, data shaping technology, and streaming analytics, I think that's really resonating with customers and we saw that in Q1. Our ability to provide that full security lifecycle of prevention, detection, response, and ultimately prediction on one platform is really what the market needs. And so as Patrick said, the vast majority of our Cb Defense deals were rip and replace, and we expect that trend to continue."
Patrick Morley,1,"Yes, the only thing I would- this is Patrick. The only thing I would add to that is just that you know certainly the fact that the foundational component of our solution, which is very differentiated, that unfiltered data gives us that EDR capability inside of Cb Defense that provides tremendous perspectives for security operation center teams or security personnel to be able to understand what's happening inside the environment beyond just the preventative capabilities for Cb Defense."
Sterling Auty,1,"Got it and then one follow up question, when you bring Cb Response into the Predictive Security Cloud, is that aimed at getting an up-sell to your Cb Defense customers or is this aimed at going after incident response and other EDR opportunities where cloud based EDR might be the better fit?"
Michael Viscuso,1,"Yes, this is Mike Viscuso again. Thanks Sterling for the question. We see it both ways, we're actually the route to market in the first product that a customer purchases, it could be either one depending on what staff they have. So we see it as both an opportunity that is response on the PSC as an entry into a new customer where we would then up-sell Cb Defense to replace their legacy ineffective antivirus as well as the other way around where a customer would buy Cb Defense first to replace their legacy antivirus and then add on Cb Response for their SOC and IR teams.
We do also see in the past we've referred to the incident response channel as a big differentiator for us in the go-to-market side, we do see with the addition of Cb Response on the PSC, a great leave behind opportunity because now they have a single agent, a single console, and a choice of multiple different products, including Cb Defense for that customer after the incident response team leaves."
Sterling Auty,1,"Got it, thank you."
Operator,1,Thank you and our next question will come from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Jonathan Ho,1,"Hi, let me echo my congratulations on the quarter. I just wanted to go back to the VMware opportunity. Can you maybe give us a sense of how large an opportunity this could be and maybe how quickly you see that ramping? I know you gave us some of the timing around when it will be deployed and when it'll show through in the channel, but can you just give us a sense of the magnitude?"
Patrick Morley,1,"Yes, so hi Jonathan, thanks for the question. We're really excited about the partnership with VMware as a vendor I mean they are certainly the leader in that marketplace and they dominate in software-defined data center. And the opportunity that we have, partner with them, they've introduced a product into the market that they call App Defense which is really the first time to be able to provide additional capabilities for software-defined data center teams, visibility into inside of what's happening inside of that virtualized environment.
And Cb Defense for VMware which we built in conjunction with VMware allows SOC teams, the security operations teams and security personnel to be able to actually leverage our capabilities in conjunction with App Defense to provide just what we’ve described already, that whole lifecycle for the software-defined data center in a way that hasn’t be possible for. So if you think about preventative capabilities, detection, you think about visibility, you think about response, reducing dwell times, it's a really powerful opportunity.
One of the challenges inside of the software defined data center is that in many cases these VMs are being spun up and spun down on a very consistent basis and there's a lack of understanding of exactly what's happening right now inside that environment. And so this combination really allows organizations to provide the full security lifecycle inside of the software-defined data center. And so, as I said in the opening remarks from a go-to-market standpoint really just this quarter getting on Q2 from a joint selling standpoint, we introduced the product in Q1."
Jonathan Ho,1,"Got it, and then relative to your international opportunities, can you talk about where you're seeing success and maybe where you're making investments and maybe where we are in terms of that international contribution and where that can go over time? Thank you."
Patrick Morley,1,"Yes, so international is a marketplace where we have tremendous opportunity. And we're very excited about what the investments we're making there. Our CRO brings tremendous - Thomas Hansen brings tremendous international experience to bear and is very focused on a core set of markets which we've talked about previously. But we think about global markets, 18 different markets that we're going after, that we're investing in specifically to go provide our Predictive Security Cloud and our entire portfolio.
And we're doing it the same way we've done it historically here in North America, leveraging the power of the channel. Last year 13% of our revenue was international. So we have tremendous opportunity in front of us. And just group points for that was for example one of the wins I talked about was that big win in APAC which is a 50,000 C take out of legacy AV with Cb Defense, those - that's the type of opportunity we think we have in these markets."
Jonathan Ho,1,Thank you.
Operator,1,Thank you and our next question will come from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Michael Turits,1,"Hey guys Michael Turits. First the question on the next gen endpoint cycle, a few years ago it felt like people were looking to buy endpoint products and have multiple products on the endpoint it might have been traditionally AV and were doing add-ons. Where are we in that cycle? Are we at the point now where customers who were in that phase are now looking for a single solution and are you capitalizing on that?"
Michael Viscuso,1,"Hey Michael, its Mike Viscuso here. Yes, I think you summed it up right. Two years ago it was augmentation or supplementation on the endpoint, but we are seeing that it will be a little bit hyper bulk to say every company in the world is looking at next gen, but we are seeing that in our pipeline the significant number percentage wise is looking to replace legacy AV. And I think the biggest reason is just that as breaches continue to happen they realize that they have to do something different on the endpoint, two macro trends in IT that we all see and experience even as consumers.
The first is mobility, all of our employees for sure expect to be able to do their job from Starbucks or their home and the second is cloud as businesses move their critical IT assets and applications into the cloud, that's really exposing endpoints away from that network based security and putting a lot more emphasis or responsibility on endpoint security platforms that quite frankly legacy antivirus cannot keep up with.
And so given those trends C servers around the world are saying, if I don't do something new I'm going to get fired, and so they're looking for a full on replacement of that legacy and effective antivirus for next gen endpoint security platform that's one of the biggest drivers of our growth."
Michael Turits,1,"Thanks Mike and then a followup perhaps for you as well. You’ve talk about the introduction in the next year of Workloads and LiveOps. Can you drill down a little bit on what obviously as road map, what you can tell us about what the functionality and the scope of those products might be?"
Michael Viscuso,1,"Sure, yes. As Patrick said, on the Predictive Security Cloud today we have three products, we had Cb Defense, we have Cb Defense for VMware and Cb ThreatSight and over the course of the next twelve months we intend to introduce three additional security products on to the predictive security cloud at Cb LiveOps, Cb Response and Cb Workloads. So if I go in that order, CB LiveOps is the ability to in real time query the current state of your enterprise and get an answer back very quickly, so you can think of it as a deep inspection of your enterprise to get the current state.
I'd like to give an example of saying, hey show me all endpoints that have this particular registry key set to X and for those endpoints set it to Y, and you can do that very quickly from the cloud regardless of where those endpoints are across the world. The big IT and security use case and we're seeing a lot of traction within our design partner program for LiveOps. Design partners today have that product and are running it in their environment and we're getting a lot of great feedback.
Cb Response is the same threat hunting and incident response product that we traditionally had on-prim moving into the predictive platform. This is one of the products that we're most known for, we're really excited about bringing that threat hunting and incident response capability into the Predictive Security Cloud to augment or as Sterling mentioned, be the first product in. To augment Cb Defense would be the first product in.
And then Cb Workload which will be a cloud native endpoint security solution tailor made for the Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure which will combine a few of the other features from other products, but be optimized for those native cloud environments. So those three new products we intend to bring out over the course of the next 12 months, two of which are in design partners hands today that's Cb LiveOps and Cb Response."
Michael Turits,1,Great Mike. Thank you.
Operator,1,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.
Gregg Moskowitz,1,"Okay, thank you and I'll add my congratulations as well. Patrick, your cloud business is obviously growing rapidly, but qualitatively speaking, how would you characterize this desire of both enterprises and SMBs deploy endpoint security in the cloud today vis-à-vis on-premise?"
Patrick Morley,1,"Hey Gregg, yes on the cloud versus on-perm obviously the fact that we have a portfolio that spans both, gives us I think a really powerful story for customers depending on where they fit in that view of do they want the capabilities on-prem or are they getting increasingly comfortable with cloud deployed solutions like the predictive security cloud. And certainly, the trend that we're seeing right now and we're leading with it, is this move to willingness to actually have those capabilities in the cloud because of the dynamics from total cost of ownership, the dynamics from a deployment standpoint, it allows these organizations to deploy faster, to see the benefits of the solution faster.
So we certainly are seeing more and more customers getting comfortable with cloud deployed solutions like the Predictive Security Cloud. There are absolutely customer segments that still want to stay on-prem and we’re in a position to help them to, but the market is moving towards the cloud."
Gregg Moskowitz,1,"Okay great and then Mark as you know they grew 37% this quarter. I know you don’t explicitly guide to it, but just generally speaking, how are you thinking about ARR growth over the remainder of the year?"
Patrick Morley,1,"Yes, I think you have to look to the revenue growth, there were related metrics, as you know we've talked a little bit about recurring revenue and the fact that it's growing faster than our overall revenue driven by the fact that all of our cloud products are obviously subscription and that they need less services and perpetual is coming down also to be a much smaller part of the business than it was if you go back a few years. So again, as you point out we're not giving guidance on ARR, but we’ll move generally in line with revenue although we'll need as opposed to fall in a ratable revenue model."
Gregg Moskowitz,1,"Great, thank you thank."
Operator,1,Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Rob Owens of KeyBanc Capital. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst,1,"Hi this is Liz [indiscernible] on for Rob. Thanks for taking the question. Just want to follow up on the commentary on the three potentially TAM expanding products coming to market. You mentioned that they are planned over the next 12 months. Is there any further sense you can give us in terms of timing for any of those releases and then to what extent or if at all is that factored into the annual guidance you provided? And that's all from me, thanks."
Michael Viscuso,1,"Liz this is Mike Viscuso. I’ll start out and then I'll let Mark take the tail end of your question. So as Michael had asked about the three new products, Cb LiveOps is with our design partners right now. We intend to be GA within the next two quarters, so we're very excited about that product. Cb Response is also with design partners. We intend to be GA with that product within the next three quarters and Cb Workloads is coming on the heels of those two. As I said, we're very excited about the three new products. This is a great testament of the unfiltered data and our ability to provide additional capabilities on the Predictive Security Cloud platform.
And as we move the development into the cloud it allows us to develop these capabilities incrementally, get them into market as I've just mentioned with design partners very quickly and then rapidly scale up from there. We're seeing huge benefits from being able to develop on the Predictive Security Cloud platform, cloud native type development efforts versus on-prem, so very excited."
Mark Sullivan,1,I mean with regard to guidance I think we should assume we have really very little baked into our 2018 guidance. Really most of the momentum and growth in the business as we've talked about extensively here on the call is coming from the Cb Defense product on the PSC platform as well as our on premise products which still continue to grow. I mean we really expect to see much more of a significant contribution to business growth from these new products that are coming to market in 2019.
Unidentified Analyst,1,That's helpful. Thanks.
Operator,1,"Thank you. And I’m showing no further questions in the queue, so now I'd like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Patrick Morley, Chief Executive Officer for some closing comments or remarks."
Patrick Morley,1,"Yes, on behalf of the Carbon Black team here in the room and all of the team at Carbon Black, everyone, I want to just say thanks for participating in our first earnings call and we're very excited about the opportunity in front of Carbon Black to continue to build a leader in this space and I look forward to speaking to you over the coming quarters as a public company. Thank you. 
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude our program and we’ll now disconnect. Everybody have a wonderful day."
