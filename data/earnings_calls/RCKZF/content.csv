Operator,0,"Dear, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Conference Call of Rocket Internet SE. At our customers’ request, this conference will be recorded. As a reminder, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]
May I now hand you over to Mr. Peter Kimpel, who will lead you through this conference. Please go ahead, sir."
Peter Kimpel,0,"Good morning, everybody. And welcome to our first quarter 2018 results. Today, on the call, you’ve got Oliver, our CEO; and myself, Peter Kimpel. I will go first and give you an overview of our selected companies. Again, as you know we’ve got our two publicly quoted participations. On the one hand, Delivery Hero where we hold now 8% and HelloFresh where we hold now 36% post the offering a couple of weeks ago. And then we’ve got our four privately held companies in the Fashion segment, the General Merchandise segment and in the Home & Living segment.
What we’ve done, as you’ve seen probably in the presentation, we stopped providing our aggregate figures across the different companies for that reason that we have now two publicly quoted companies and Home24 has just recently announced on the 18th of May that they intend to go public as well, so that we only have three privately held companies hopefully then in our portfolio in a couple of weeks time. And so and given the fact that they’re also disclosing the figures individually, we have decided that at this point of time it doesn’t make sense anymore to provide aggregate figures across the portfolio of companies and rather than focus on the individual companies and their performance.
With that introduction, let’s go straight into the figures which display again that we continued to show and the companies continued to show growth across the board and also significantly improved profitability. We have on the one hand again HelloFresh with close to 50% growth at Global Fashion Group, which announced their financials last Friday. On a euro basis clearly growth has slowed but that has been predominantly driven by FX effects. So without the FX effects on a constant currency basis, Global Fashion Group as a whole has shown an 18% top line growth. And Jumia and Home & Living businesses again have reaccelerated their growth with Jumia and the GMV growth of more than 70% and Westwing and Home24 with 18% and 25% revenue growth respectively.
So continued -- as we had prominent continued top line growth, which is coupled on Page 6 with also improvement in profitability, so with HelloFresh significantly improving profitability halving the EBITDA margin, Global Fashion Group, slight improvement, Jumia also a 7 percentage point improvement, Westwing hosting the second consecutive profitable quarter, improving significantly from last year and Home24 also nearly halving of negative EBITDA margin improving by 5 percentage points. So again, continued growth across the portfolio of companies coupled with continued also profitability improvement.
With regard to the companies, Delivery Hero and HelloFresh clearly as publically quoted companies have shown their numbers. But just again to recap a little bit, Delivery Hero continued also strong growth with nearly 50% top line growth both on a revenue level as well as number of orders level, so very continued strong performance which has been reflected in a very continued share price improvement. HelloFresh very similar story as well, top line growth of nearly 45% year-over-year in the quarter with a significant improvement in profitability, so again also very strong in Q1 which has been also reflected in share price.
Now, let’s rather focus on the privately held companies. First of all, our Fashion business, Global Fashion Group, which again continues to on the euro base has continued to grow. We’ve got three nearly equally sized businesses with Lamoda in Russia, CIS, Dafiti in Brazil, Latin America and Zalora and The Iconic in Southeast Asia and Australia, respectively with 81 million, 75 million and 77 million contribution in terms of net revenues in the first quarter -- for the first quarter of nearly €240 million of revenues, so again, three relatively equally sized businesses with Zalora and The Iconic having caught up to Lamoda and Dafiti, respectively, posting stronger growth than the two businesses.
If you go to Page 10. On the consolidated basis again as I’ve said before and the introductory remarks on a euro basis, growth had slowed from roughly 25% to the 4%. The right way in our mind to think about the business given the fact that we’ve got very diverse business and emerging market businesses is the right way to look at is actually on a constant currency basis. So on a constant currency basis, net merchandise value, which includes the marketplace revenues, the pro forma growth was close to 20% with 19.9% for the first quarter, reaching close to 250 million in revenues. If you look at on a net revenue basis, the focus end growth actually translates into onto on a constant currency basis more closer to 18%.
Again, this has been driven by a weak performance of the Russian ruble and the Brazilian real and also somewhat the Australian dollar. So most of the business have been hit by the weakening local currencies, which again has been having a significant impact on euro-denominated top line growth. I will turn now to profitability and the business continues to be and roughly about 14% the negative EBITDA margin, which is being driven, as we go into this deal by some local developments with regards to also some competitive implications. But at the same time, it has been also offset by efficiencies movement initiatives at the different businesses and also the benefits of increasing scale on the local currency basis. We continue to hold 20% of the business. And again, overall, despite the overall sort of challenges of the business in both Russia and Brazil, the business has been doing as we would have expected in the first quarter.
Now let’s go into the individual businesses. Lamoda again probably with is of the weakest performance of the three businesses. On a constant currency basis, NMV grew roughly about 5%. What, that was again driven predominantly by the weak ruble. In addition, we had also some seasonality impact. So we have a delayed seasonal switch to the summer season inventory, given the fact that the weather in Russia was, continued to be cold and not particularly enticing for people to buy summer and spring clothes. So we had sort of the combined impact of, on the one hand, weak ruble, as well as the sort of the delayed seasonal switch to the summer season inventory, which has driven some of the weaker top line growth, which again on a euro basis was minus 9% in that case.
On the other hand we've maintained sort of the gross margin at 34%, so slightly above over the last year. So on the one hand so top line growth we can on profitability having improved a little bit. So again I think in the context of the macro-economic situation as sanctioned as well as the weaker ruble, a decent quarter for Lamoda. Dafiti, on Page 12, we see a different story again on a local currency basis strong, growth 24% which is up on a FX neutral basis nearly maybe a twice the level of where we were last year. So that's promising again the problem is the FX related impact which can drive sound that growth on a year-over-year basis and to focus in. But continued to the strong margin at roughly about the 41% gross margin, so overall again a very decent quarter and if you look at it on the constant currency basis, Dafiti has actually performed -- has performed well.
On Zalora, so the Southeast-based Asian business and iconic again very similar picture, we see on a constant currency basis, strong growth of more than 30% which is higher than towards the overall growth last year. Having business growing from 65 million in the first quarter to 77 million, so it's significantly up. If you look at net merchandise value, we are talking about actually 85 million so a growth of actually more than 37% on a constant currency basis, so again on a top line basis quiet a good quarter the impact again has been FX related where I mean Euro basis given the weaker than Australian dollar has only translated into a quarter-over-quarter growth of 148%. But overall we see so as of the top line and positive trend and despite Amazon going into the market and aces continuing to play, we see continued growth and continued top line and positive performance in particular with the iconic in Australia.
Our gross margin, we've seen a slight decline from 40.7% down to 37.2%, which is a decline of roughly about 3.5% percentage points which has been a result of increased promotional activity and stock clearance in the first quarter getting rid of the summer season inventory in the region. But again overall, if we look at GFG story on a constant currency basis is that two of the businesses actually had performed very well. Lamoda again having a weaker given the seasonal implications, but overall GFG performing also according to plan with the continued growth and somewhat improving profitability.
Moving on to Africa and our General Merchandize business, Jumia business has reaccelerated the growth. So looking at the top line, so it grows merchandize value has grown from 89 million to more than a €150 million. So being on a run rate for actually about €600 million which represents a growth of 71% which is very, very significant and again it is a acceleration from where we've seen last year where the average growth over 2016 was 22% the overall reacceleration of the growth that has reinstated also in significant revenue growth business now is being at a run rate of more than 100 million in revenues with a year-over-year growth of 46% for the quarter, which again is significantly up from where we were last year on average, where the business was growing roughly about 11%.
We see also gross profit margin improvement in Q1, which has been predominantly driven by increased market created volumes and also some of the growth in the value added services, which also been translated into adjusted EBITDA margin improvement versus GMV saving about 7 percentage points going from 27% negative to roughly about 20% in Q1. Jumia continues to be well capitalized with more than €200 million pro forma for commitments and so overall, despite the fact that the business continues to invest in further growth in the region business continues to be very well capitalized.
So I think the story to take away from Jumia is continued growth, and some of the reacceleration of the growth in Q1 from what we’ve seen in 2017. And the business overall being extremely well positioned with our strategic partners in the region, had continue to execute well on all fronts launching new brands and leading price positions in particular also on the mobile phone side, which is one of the lead product. So overall continues to execute according to plan, and continues to grow market leadership on the African continent.
Then moving to our Home & Living businesses. Westwing which posted again a profitable quarter in Q4, had posted the second consecutive profitable quarter in the first quarter of 2018. But also reaccelerating the growth on the top line with revenue growth of more than 18%, actually on a constant currency basis growth would have been more than 21%, which has being driven predominantly by our profitable DACH region. So DACH, stand for Germany, Austria, Switzerland. So business doing very well and continues to grow profitably at a much more significantly improved top line as well. So, again, second profitable quarter and an adjusted EBITDA margin basis now being at roughly at about 2%.
So a percentage point improvement from the first quarter of 2017. So, company continues to be extremely well positioned. The organic marketing driving the continued growth, again top line and the business is predominantly at this point in time, driven by the business model, which they’ve executed with the shop -- the WestwingNow shop in the DACH region, which has been driving again a lot of the top line growth and also profitability improvement. Business again very -- performing well, with again top line growth and also stable margins and improving bottom line margins representing the overall improvement also in scale. So, Westwing very well positioned in the market, top brand and continuing to execute, according to what we had promised, last year, moving away from sort of the most stagnant growth to the higher top line growth.
Very similar picture on Home24, as I said and some of you may have met the Company or the analysts over the last couple of weeks, Home24 announced that they intend to go public on the 18th of May, business has performed in Q1, strongly with acceleration of growth and maybe twice the growth of what we’ve seen in 2017, improving top line revenues from 68 million to maybe 85 million in the first quarter of 2018 with a strong gross profit margin of close to 45% and significantly improved also adjusted EBITDA margin of minus 6% which is an improvement of nearly 5 percentage points versus Q1 last year. So again, the results show that Home24 has been very successful and has created sustainable growth story.
And as I said, a number of you will have met them or will meet the management team over the next couple of weeks, and we will hear more in detail from the management team about further next steps and continued path of the business going forward which again is continued top line growth and also a further improvement in profitability. So overall, when you look at the results, both Home & Living companies have performed very strongly, Jumia as well and GFG has been impacted by again some seasonal effects and by local macro conditions as well as in particular the FX development.
So when you sum it up including our public companies, we are quite happy with the results, with -- across the board with again one company being slightly weaker coming in and the others probably coming in probably ahead a little bit of what had be planned. So overall, I think a very positive quarter for the group, which has also been reflected somewhat in our consolidated financials where we posted a profit of 75 million for the quarter which has been driven by a couple of effects.
On the one hand, we've had sort of lower negative equity pickups of the results of the Company, so lower losses which we account for as equity in our share of the profit, loss of associates and joint ventures line. We also had some in-disposal gains from financing rounds at Traveloka and ZipJet, which accounted for in the first quarter and then we had also some impact clearly from Delivery Hero related effects gains from the stronger share price of all remaining stake and then also the closing of some of the sales which we had announced last year, which also had a very positive effect on our financial results, which ultimately then resulted in a positive result of 75 million for first quarter which is very encouraging sign.
On the balance sheet, the main effect has been also Delivery Hero related because we decreased non-current financial assets because of the sale of shares in the first quarter. And the other current financial assets have been decreased also predominantly because of the closing of the sale of the shares in Delivery Hero to Naspers. And there was one significant impact on the liability side. As you probably -- as we’ve discussed in the past we had accounted for the Naspers transaction as a derivative transaction for the forward sale that we had a financial liability on the liabilities side as a result of that accounting treatment of roughly about 80 million. And due to the sale and the closing of the transaction, we derecognized the financial liability which came again from the forward agreement, so that was derecognized also in the first quarter hence a reduction in the current financial liabilities in Q1 2018.
So those have been the major items on a consolidated level. Since the quarter-end close Q1, we had a number of significant transactions and events. On the one hand we placed an 8% stake of HelloFresh in an ABO, decreasing our ownership stake from 44% to 36%. So we have at a current market cap of around 1.8 billion, we hold still about 670 million worth of HelloFresh stock. So we’re quite happy with that. In addition, which you may seen on page 20m we’ve also sold Daraz, which is the leading online shopping destination in South Asia so predominantly, clearly, in the markets Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Myanmar.
We’ve sold that to Alibaba, so a similar transaction to the Lazada transaction and the realized amount to Rocket ultimately is roughly 34 million. So again, I think underlying saw the ability of Rocket to build interesting and attractive companies also to some of the market leaders, such as Alibaba. Then furthermore, we launched a share buyback in May as well where we repurchased a total volume of €333 million, which equated to 9.7 million shares at the tender offer price of 24. So, the total Rocket Internet stake repurchased in the tender offer was 5.9%. In addition to that, we had through our normal share buyback program. We had to repurchase about €21 million. We canceled the total, we canceled all of the treasury shares as a result of it and the normal share buyback as well as the tender offer.
So they have been canceled and the new outstanding position of Rocket share is now 154.4 million shares outstanding down again from more than 165 million shares, which we previously had. So that has been effective as of the last week, and so just that you have that to build that into your model, so those are the new share numbers. Adjusting for all of the effects, so that’s why we have cash position on Page 22 displayed as of May 15, so that we account for all of those transactions and in particular also the tender offer. Our new gross cash position is €2.6 billion, which then translates into a net cash position of €2.3 billion, again deducing our still remaining outstanding convertible of roughly about 300 million.
So continue to just be a very strong capitalized and a significant liquidity position. And Oliver will probably say a very few words then also on that. And next steps, from a financial calendar perspective, we have our annual meeting on June 8, so next week. So, where we may see some of you and then we have our first half results in September. And in November will again hold our Capital Markets Day, combined with our third quarter financials in London. So those are going to be the next steps.
And with that, I hand over to Oliver for some closing remarks."
Oliver Samwer,0,"Yes. Good morning from my side, too. I think this quarter again shows continues progress, if you look at the progress of Delivery Hero, of HelloFresh, I think you see significant progress. If you look at in the furniture side, Home24 and Westwing making very good progress on growth and on path profitability, Jumia again, also on very strong growth, I think it’s a combination of growth and path to profitability. At the same time, we’re very strong cash position to take advantage of opportunities. Our team is looking around to grow that opportunities and we continue to be confident to see exciting new business opportunities in the coming years.
I think we will open up for questions operator please."
Operator,1,Thank you. Then we will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We've received the first question it comes from Marcus Diebel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Marcus Diebel,1,"Two questions for me from my side. The first question is on the path of profitability. Is it fair to assume that these trends, broadly, will continue in terms of profitability in the next couple of quarters? I guess, we've seen a nice improvement over the last few quarters, but is it fair to -- you kind of draw the line now towards profitability or is there a scenario that you see that investments will actually spike and some of your businesses from here? I mean, we've seen Jumia just wondered if there's the chance that investments also go up and be a bit more volatile from here. And second question is on HelloFresh, again you're placing. I mean, clearly, you mentioned several times that you feel HelloFresh is undervalued. At this level, the business is doing fairly well. Could you just help us understand why you found a placing necessary at this point in time, given also your €2.6 billion cash part? Would be helpful if you can give at least some words on that topic?"
Oliver Samwer,1,"So with regards to the continuous path to profitability, the first part of the question, I think we do not comment on the public companies. So Delivery Hero and HelloFresh have their guidance out there. I think when we talk about our furniture companies. I think I comment on Westwing, I think Home24 has its own announcements. I think we continue to believe that this combination of growth and path to profitability is the way going forward. I think, Jumia, as you know, is sitting on a huge opportunity in Africa. I think we'll make the right decisions there. I think growth there is tremendous. And I think the Company wants to keep it that way.
I think, on Global Fashion, I think they're also primarily making their own announcements, so I don't want to interfere with them. With regards to HelloFresh, I think it's always kind of like, if you look it all, it's from the public position, so our largest position -- or both our largest positions. And we feel confident that our current stake is very interesting and that we have a lot of room to participate in the future growth. I think, before that, it was a rather very big position of ours. And I think in a smart, I would say, allocation, I think it was the right decision, and I think we feel very strong and very positive about the Company."
Operator,1,Thank you. The next question is from Sarah Simon. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Sarah Simon,1,"I've got a few questions. First was on Daraz. Can you give us an idea of what the cash-on-cash multiple would be? That -- I know the investment was done through Asia Pacific Group. You've given the €34 million. I'm just wondering how much Asia Pacific put in or if you can give us a cash-on-cash return on that one. Secondly, Marley Spoon is obviously IPO-ing, and you are a significant shareholder in that. And again, I was wondering if you could give us an idea of how much cash Rocket has invested in Marley Spoon. The third one was on GFG and the cash. I know these questions were asked on Friday, but I was just wondering if you can help us a bit more in terms of the moving parts between the December cash balance and the March one, because that seems to have worried people. I know there's FX, but if you can quantify that a bit more. And then the fourth one, you mentioned Lamoda being affected by the very cold weather. And I'm just wondering if you can say anything about kind of current trading in Q2, as to whether that's improved or not, at least from the weather perspective."
Oliver Samwer,1,"So I do the first 2. I think the Asia Internet holding is a joint venture between us and Ooredoo. Ooredoo is also a public company, and therefore, we cannot make any statements that has not been agreed and publicly put out. I think, with regards to Marley Spoon, we hold shares in that company, and I think we don't comment relative to HelloFresh. It's a very small position, and we don't make public announcement here. I think, Peter, on the cash bridge and on Lamoda, I think you should comment."
Peter Kimpel,1,"Yes. The cash bridge, Sarah, we can get to you in the detail on that, so we can have that -- take that off-line. And then the second question on the weather, I think it's too early to tell, so we haven't gotten the updates, so we only have the -- we only have the April numbers so far, so it's too early to tell how the quarter is really going to shape up in Q2, so you have to bear with us on that, unfortunately."
Sarah Simon,1,"Just back on Asia Internet, can you give us any idea of how much cash the whole of Asia Internet has invested so far?"
Oliver Samwer,1,"No. I think, given that we have a partner here and we have very strict confidentiality with Ooredoo, I think the company, at this time, might make announcement. But in joint ventures, we cannot just make announcements ourselves."
Peter Kimpel,1,"And Sarah, to give that €34 million is already a bit of a stretch because we agreed complete confidentiality with Alibaba on the valuation and proceeds. So we sort of tried to make a compromise in giving some sort of transparency around what we've made, so that at least people can then make the, ultimately, the cash purchase well. But on the Daraz transaction, the company and Alibaba agreed complete confidentiality on the valuation of that deal. So you have to bear with us, unfortunately, on that one as well."
Sarah Simon,1,I'll ask one last one on Daraz then. Is that 34 million being -- is it coming back to Rocket Holdco or is staying within Asia Internet? I just wonder if it's in the cash number you gave for the -- of the 2.6 billion?
Oliver Samwer,1,"It’s not -- that’s not yet in -- it’s not yet in the cash number, no. That’s not yet in the -- no."
Sarah Simon,1,"It's not on the cash number, but will it come back? I mean, I know it's only small, but when does it stay within the holding company?"
Oliver Samwer,1,"No, it will come back."
Operator,1,Thank you. The next question is from Nizla Naizer of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Nizla Naizer,1,"I just have a few on my end. The first question is on Westwing. Given their current profitability stage and the cash position that the company has reported at the end of Q1, do you think that it could sustain its growth momentum without needing to raise more funding? Or would this be something we will see over the course of 2018? And my second question is related to Daraz, but not specifically. After the sale of Daraz, could you perhaps tell us what are the remaining large companies in the regional Internet groups and which Internet group they belong to? And my final question, you mentioned Traveloka and ZipJet and the favorable valuation changes in Q1. Could you give us an idea as to the size of both of these companies in terms of the implied valuation after their last funding rounds?"
Oliver Samwer,1,"So with regard to the first question, I think we are currently not planning for any amount. I think with regards to Daraz and region holdings, I think Daraz was one of the key holdings in Asia Internet holding. In the LatAm Internet holding, there are no key assets anymore. So I think in the Middle East Internet holding, there are some assets, but overall, I don't think they play a very important role in the business and the valuation of our company. I think the direct assets are much more relevant.
And I think with regards to some of the companies you mentioned, Traveloka, ZipJet, et cetera, I think we can only refer to what the publicly available data. I think at the point of time when Traveloka did an announcement, I think there was announcement about how much cap the company raised. I think it's still rate information about how much our company holds about that, obviously, we also got diluted in different transactions. So I think we can, at this point of time, before those company reach a critical scale for us, I'll not make any specific announcement on all of those individual companies. We keep that as practice in the past once company reach a critical stage scale and stage, that we then make announcements."
Nizla Naizer,1,"Great. And I guess, just a follow-up on the cash position that Rocket has as well. Could you remind us again what sort of sectors are most interesting for you going forward as to where to deploy that significant cash that you have?"
Oliver Samwer,1,"So we look a lot of the fintech space. I think we did a number of investments there. We are invested in some very interesting companies. We continue to look at market places and a number of vertical market places. We look at direct-to-consumer brands. We have made a couple of artificial intelligent investments. I think all of those areas that we watch very clearly, we have a number of professionals looking at opportunities in them. I think the time will come to deploy our capital over time without having the pressure and, at the same time, maybe the patience to look for the right opportunities."
Operator,1,"At the moment, there are no further questions. [Operation Instructions] As there are no further questions, I would hand back to you."
Peter Kimpel,1,"Okay. Then now we conclude with this, and we'll speak whoever is coming for the AGM. We'll see each other then next week. Other than that, we'll then continue to talk. And if there's any other questions which come to mind over the course of today or tomorrow, again, please feel free to reach out to us, so we answer them. Have a good day. Thank you very much."
Operator,1,"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attendance. This call has been concluded. You may disconnect."
Oliver Samwer,1,Thank you.
