Keri Jones,0,"Thank you, Jean. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I am very excited to be here and I look forward to working with the team, as we build upon the progress that has been made over the last several quarters, and move forward on developing a multiyear strategic plan.
I was drawn to this opportunity, as I believe that Christopher & Banks has a unique position within the apparel industry, as we specialize in the underserved segment of the apparel market, we have maintained an extremely loyal customer base, and we have a strong and growing e-commerce business. I believe, that I can draw from my extensive retail background in successfully transforming both growth and challenged businesses, resulting in sustainable, long term, profitable growth for CBK, through a focus on customer driven strategies and disciplined execution.
Now turning briefly to our first quarter results; sales were $85.9 million, a decrease of 3% and down 2.6% on a comp store basis. The lower than anticipated sales were due in part to our underperformance in woven jackets and bottoms, and unseasonal weather, particularly at our Midwest and Northeast regions, where a significant portion of our stores are located.
Sales picked up in April, as the weather became more seasonal and this sales momentum has continued into May, which quarter-to-date has comped up in the low single digits.
As you know, meaningful enhancements were made to our merchandise assortments over the past several quarters. We are pleased with our customer's reaction to the increased mix of fashion in our assortment, as well as in our response to, what I would call, our Hero categories, such as Novelty Knit tops and Relaxed Restyled.
Additionally, we saw continued momentum in our e-commerce business, as well as in our outlet stores, both of which delivered positive sales comps in the quarter.
While the steps we took in the first quarter to ensure our inventory was fresh at the beginning of Q2 pressured our gross margins, they also better positioned us for the remainder of the spring summer selling season.
In addition, we further strengthened our financial flexibility during the quarter, with the closing of our sale and leaseback of our corporate facility. Marc will provide more details on our financials shortly.
Now turning to our strategy; during my first three months at Christopher & Banks, I have been focused on gaining a deeper understanding of our customer, analyzing key metrics, assessing our operational capabilities and processes, and taking learnings from past quarters, to develop strategic priorities for success in fiscal 2018 and beyond.
These strategic priorities will be rooted in a customer centric approach, and a focus on leveraging data and analytics across business functions, to ensure we consistently deliver on our customers' evolving expectations. There are five key priorities intended to drive improved comparable year-over-year sales and EBITDA performance for fiscal 2018.
First, we want to enhance for shopping experience, with a well curated merchandise assortment, that meets our need and is easy for her to shop.
Second, we want to create compelling marketing campaigns and effective promotions that clearly illustrate our value propositions, while enabling us to optimize our merchandise margins.
Third, we want to leverage our omnichannel capabilities, to ensure she can shop seamlessly across all channels, while providing an exceptional shopping experience.
And fourth, we are extremely proud to be an organization with tremendous customer loyalty, but we need to create a plan to capture that customer, who has not yet discovered what the existing Christopher & Banks customers have come to love. And finally, we will continue to focus on reducing our cost structure.
These key priorities will be executed, with a maniacal focus on driving positive sales comp, improved financial performance, and positive cash flow in fiscal 2018.
Now, I'd like to provide some additional color on each. First, enhancing and simplifying her shopping experience, by making it easier for her to find an outfit she loves and the sizes that she needs.
Over the past year, there was a considerable effort made to rebalance the assortment and offer more choices, in addition to a greater mix of fashion. These enhancements, have been met with great response. However, as with any major change, there are areas to improve upon. I believe, that we have an opportunity to streamline the breadth of our assortment, while maintaining a high level of fashion in our mix. This effort should enhance our shopping experience, making it easier to shop, by offering a more compelling visual presentation, and increase the efficiency and profitability of our inventory, driving higher turns and improved margins.
We will also continue to leverage our recently implemented planning tool by tearing [ph] stores by size in category, to optimize inventory and ensure, she can always find the size that she needs.
In addition, we will review our sourcing and product development calendar, to ensure that we have the speed and flexibility to quickly adapt to her evolving expectations.
Second, delivering compelling promotions through a more disciplined strategy. As we position the business, we must also better leverage our data and tool to execute a promotional strategy that will drive traffic and conversion, while optimizing our margin. We know that our customer is drawn to the style, quality and value that we offer, and we are not thinking about moving away from our value positioning. However, there is an opportunity to better leverage our data and I believe, drive fewer, more meaningful promotion. This is the dynamic part of the business, and we will continue to analyze, test, react, and refine our promotional strategy, to ensure that we are providing the best offers for our customer, and one that supports the financial goals of the business.
Third, leverage our omnichannel capabilities through flexible fulfillment options and through an improved site experience. As I stated earlier, we have a strong and growing e-commerce business, and we will continue to enhance our omnichannel capabilities, to give her a seamless shopping experience across channel.
We recently launched, buy online, ship to store, and began a pilot on ship from store. This summer, we will begin a pilot of buy online pickup in store. Given our early results and my past experience, I am very excited about what this could mean for our business. We believe, these capabilities will drive sales and allow us to leverage our inventory, but most importantly, give her an experience that builds loyalty, and will allow us to expand our customer base.
While we have a well established and growing e-commerce business, we see an opportunity to elevate our web site. Some of these initiatives include, enhancing product recommendation capabilities, increasing site speed, and making it easier for her to create an account. We believe these enhancements will further improve our online experience and drive higher conversion on our sites.
Fourth, capture the customer who has not yet discovered what Christopher & Banks has to offer. As you heard during our Q4 call, the customer base has been stabilized, and now we are very focused on increasing our total customer file. We believe, that leveraging digital marketing is one of the best ways to acquire new customers, and we are shifting a greater mix of our marketing spend to digital. As we move forward with these initiatives, we will measure results to ensure we are achieving customer acquisition targets at an appropriate ROI.
The team has done an amazing job of maintaining an extremely loyal customer base. I would attribute those, in large part to the phenomenal customer service in our retail stores. Our customers love to shop in our stores and engage with our associates, and I think that is a powerful competitive advantage. We will use this competitive advantage to go after market share opportunities, resulting from changes happening in the market.
We have 55 locations in markets where our competitor department store is closing, and we believe, that we can win these customers over. We are already seeing evidence of market share gains with sales increases, as well as credit card and loyalty program growth in these markets.
Finally, but certainly not least, is our review of our cost structure. We believe that we have an opportunity to continue to reduce our expenses. We are in the process of completing a thorough review of all aspects of our business, to determine our biggest areas of cost savings opportunities.
In summary, I am excited about the opportunity ahead for Christopher & Banks, as we execute these key priorities to drive sales and profitability, I will also be working with my management team, to develop a multiyear strategic plan, which I look forward to sharing in the future.
While I am well aware of the challenges the business currently faces, I am equally excited about the significant long term opportunity for the company. I would also like to thank Joel for his stewardship over the past year, and thank and acknowledge our associates for their dedication, passion and commitment to driving our future success.
Now I will turn it over to Marc, to review our first quarter financial performance."
Marc Ungerman,0,"Thanks Keri. My financial review today will cover the first quarter ended May 5, 2018 compared to the first quarter ended April 29, 2017. Net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were $85.9 million, a decrease of 3% compared to $88.6 million in last year's first quarter. We operated on average, 3.6% pure stores as compared to last year. Comparable sales decreased 2.6% as compared to an 8.9% decrease in the same period last year.
While we saw continued strong performance in our e-commerce business, as well as positive comps in our outlet channel, comps in our full price stores declined largely due to underperformance in certain categories, in particular, woven jackets and bottoms, and in [indiscernible] weather. Average dollar sale was up 1.1%, reflecting a 6.2% increase in average unit retail, and a 4.8% decrease in units per transaction. Transactions per store decreased 3.7% and e-commerce transactions grew 2.6% compared to the same period last year.
Gross margin rate decreased 270 basis points compared to last year to 31.8% of net sales. This is primarily due to 310 basis point decrease in merchandise margin, due to increased product costs, which have been corrected for the balance of the year, and aggressive markdowns due to lower than expected sales. The decrease in merchandise margins was partially offset by lower occupancy costs, related to store closings, as well as rent reductions, as part of our effort to negotiate more favorable lease terms.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $29.7 million, compared to $31 million in last year's first quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower store operating expenses, store insurance and tax expenses and more net employee compensation expenses, partially offset by increases in professional services and marketing expenses.
As a percent of net sales, SG&A was 34.6% compared to 35% in the prior year period. Depreciation and amortization was $2.8 million compared to $3.1 million in last year's first quarter. In the first quarter of 2017, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $70,000 related to assets held at one store location.
First quarter net loss was $5.3 million or $0.14 per share. Last year's first quarter net loss was $3.7 million or $0.10 per share. As more fully explained in the financial schedules [indiscernible] press release. First quarter adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was negative $2.2 million compared to a negative $200,000 in the same period last year.
Now, turning to the balance sheet; we ended the first quarter with approximately $18.1 million of cash and cash equivalents compared to approximately $28.3 million at the end of the first quarter a year ago. We consumed $17.4 million in cash flow from operations in the first quarter compared to $4.6 million the same period last year, primarily due to changes in working capital and an increase in the net loss for the 13-week period. The working capital change is largely a reflection of seasonal pattern, a decrease in accounts payable associated with the shift in merchandise purchases overseas, that impacted timing of payments, and a change in the timing of payroll accruals.
As a reminder, we completed the sale leaseback of our corporate headquarters at the end of April, which resulted in gross proceeds of $13.7 million.
Total inventory was $46.4 million at the end of the first quarter compared to $42.1 million at the end of the first quarter a year ago, an increase of 10.2%. The increase in inventory was primarily due to higher inventory received compared to last year, to return to more normalized levels, combined with lower than expected sales.
Capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2018 were $1 million compared to $2.1 million in last year's first quarter. Capital expenditures, included investments in technology associated with our omnichannel and merchandising capabilities, and expenditures supporting new stores. We had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility at the end of the first quarter.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we adapted new revenue recognition guidance, that would manage the timing of revenue recognition, the presentation of revenue for certain items. The adoption had an immaterial impact on the company's revenue and net loss for the quarter, and had no impact on cash flow.
Under the guidance, the company has changed its recognition of gift card breakage income to be recognized proportionately as redemption occurs, rather than based on historical redemption patterns. We expect the impact of this change to be immaterial on an ongoing basis.
During the quarter, we closed one CB store and one CJ store and converted them into one MPW location. In addition, we closed one MPW store and opened one net outlet location.
Retail square feet decreased 3.1% compared to the first quarter last year. During the quarter, we operated on average 452 stores, consisting of 315 MPW stores, 78 outlet stores, 36 CB stores and 33 CJ stores.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to questions."
Operator,1,[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from Jeremy Hamblin from Dougherty and Company. Your line is now live.
Jeremy Hamblin,1,Good morning and welcome aboard Keri.
Keri Jones,1,Thank you.
Jeremy Hamblin,1,"I wanted to start with a couple of questions about the store base itself, and I know, you probably haven't exhaustively looked at the units. But in terms of thinking of the long term picture here, even the intermediate term picture on the stores, how do you feel about necessary changes, if any, to the format of locations we have kind of gone through this program of collapse and combine. Do you feel like the store count, as it is today, is fairly reflective of where you think it might be in, let's say a year and a half? Or where do you see maybe potential changes?"
Keri Jones,1,"Thanks for the question. I think I will start with the fact that the team has done a really good job of looking at the store portfolio, negotiating lease terms, both lower rents, more flexibility, shorter lease term. My point of view is, we need to get these strategic initiative sometime to bear fruit, to drive some additional sales in these stores.
That said, we will be looking at part of our multiyear strategic plan that I referenced, getting a good grip on what this needs to look like, two or three years down the road. Some of which might include, looking at markets or stores where we shouldn't be, but also include looking at opportunities to open new stores, where we know we can win."
Jeremy Hamblin,1,"Okay, great. And then I wanted to just shift gears and talk about gross margin for a second. And you know, you did see it down about 265 basis points year-over-year. Historically, you would see a stepdown in gross margin in Q2 from Q1, but my sense and from your commentary, it sounded like, there is maybe a little more aggressive promotion than anticipated. How quickly do you think that you can address that issue, in terms of moving the needle a little bit higher on gross margins overall firmwide?"
Keri Jones,1,"Yeah I would say that, as you heard in Marc's remarks, the gross margin deterioration was driven by two factors, one being the higher costs that we had, as a move to fashion apparel, and that has been corrected moving forward. And so, that takes some of the headwinds away from us. And certainly, as we turn the corner to warmer weather, we have seen comps delve into the positive territory, and so, we feel good about where we are now."
Jeremy Hamblin,1,"Okay, great. Weather clearly was a factor for a lot of retailers in the quarter, but I think your kind of outsized exposure in Midwest, Northeast, mid-Atlantic, probably was worse than most. Can you give us a sense or an estimate of kind of the range of impact that you might have had on comps here in Q1?"
Keri Jones,1,I will let Marc take that.
Marc Ungerman,1,"Yeah. Good morning Jeremy. We have looked at the impact of weather from another different angles. It's hard to measure, to isolate all the variables necessary to exactly quantify that. What we do know, is that, as the weather improves, we saw a return to positive comp territory."
Keri Jones,1,"And to your point Jeremy, we have a high preponderance of our stores in the Midwest than in the Northeast."
Jeremy Hamblin,1,"Right. You mentioned that we are up low single digits, which is really nice to see quarter-to-date. Can you give me a sense from last year, kind of the flow of comps throughout the quarter in Q2 of last year? Is May the toughest month to lap? Is it the easiest month to lap? Can you give us a sense of the flow, so we can add some context to that?"
Marc Ungerman,1,"Sure Jeremy. What I would say about last year's second quarter, is that, May was an easier comp period and our comps continue to strengthen during the course of the quarter."
Jeremy Hamblin,1,"Okay. Fair enough. And then, I wanted to ask a question about kind of cash flow and cash flow cycle that we might be able to expect for this year. So we know, that inventories were going to build a little bit, and we were hoping to see some improved results here. But in terms of thinking of kind of your cash flow cycle through the remainder of the year, how should we be looking at kind of -- if you had maybe a little more drag than we expected in Q1, some of that is timing. But how should we be thinking about that Marc, for the remainder of the year? Is that something where we would see next couple of quarters kind of holding serve here on cash flow from operations and then seeing kind of a nice cash flow during Q4? Can you give me some context on that?"
Marc Ungerman,1,"Sure Jeremy. I want to be careful that we don't get to a point where we are giving guidance. I mean, it's certainly our intention, where we expect to add to our cash coffers. There is a bit of seasonality, that we experienced here in Q1, and then as we move through the inventory and convert that to cash, that benefits us, and we have a similar phenomenon in the back half of the year. We are very active in making sure that we manage our inventory receipts in the back half of the year, to ensure again, that we are targeting positive cash flows for the year."
Jeremy Hamblin,1,"Okay. Great. And then Keri, just wanted to follow-up. You mentioned that there were 55 locations that were located, maybe collocated near a department store that was closing. And you saw nice opportunities, or you felt like you had nice opportunities to win some share there. Can you provide a little bit more color on that, in terms of the performance that you are seeing in those stores? Is it kind of -- you are already seeing performance that's maybe better than the rest of the fleet, or something where you feel like that's a strong opportunity for performance? How quickly do you think you might be able to capture some of those gains?"
Keri Jones,1,"I think, relatively quickly, we are already seeing sales above the balance of our portfolio in these markets. And the only thing we have [let up] [ph] so far, is grassroots marketing. And so, we are putting together a holistic plan to go after market share in these markets. And I think, these are customers that really fit in our sweet spot, based on where those stores are located. They see our compelling proposition of a combination of the value and the fashion and the great service we have in our stores. And so, we are already seeing customers showing up, opening up credit cards, improved comp sales in those stores.
So we will look forward to updating you on the next quarter, but we are excited about this opportunity."
Jeremy Hamblin,1,Great. Well thanks for taking my questions. I will hop out of the queue. Best of luck.
Marc Ungerman,1,Thanks Jeremy.
Operator,1,Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Keri for any further closing comments.
Keri Jones,1,"Well, thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you on our next call."
Operator,1,Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.
