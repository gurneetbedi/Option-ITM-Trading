Eyal Cohen,0,"Thank you, John. And thanks to those who have also joined the call today. I am exciting we have more than 20 participants in the call today. I will take you through the financial details of the quarter and then Yuval will provide a business overview.
Looking at the first quarter, we had a solid start of fiscal 2018 with our first quarter results reflecting our effort to expand our solution to existing and new customers. During the first quarter, we achieved strong organic revenue growth and increase of our international sales. Revenues for the quarter increased by 17% to $8.3 million. Sales for the RFID and Mobile division grew by 15% mainly related to addition of two large customers, while sales in the Supply Chain division increased by 20% related to fulfillment of orders for existing Indian customers.
On top line growth, this quarter was more organic. Gross margin was 20% which is roughly the same as a comparable quarter of 2017. While gross margin in the RFID and Mobile division improved, we saw lower margins in the Supply Chain division related to product mix and timing which impacted Supply Chain division margin performance. But as we continue through 2018, we expect to achieve blended gross margin that consistent with 2017.
Operating expenses increased as compared to the first quarter of 2017 and it was mainly attributed to a devaluation of the US dollar again the Israel NIS by 7% in the first quarter of 2018. The rest of the increase is attributed mainly to increase in revenues by 17%.
Net income grew by 32% to $205,000 or $0.06 per share. In addition, EBITDA increased by 12% to $365,000.
Turning to balance sheet. At March 2018, we had working capital of $7.1 million or current ratio of 1.9 with shareholder equity of $10.4 million, or $3.1 per share. During the first quarter, we used $300,000 for renovation of our logistics center which we believe will increase the efficiency of our operation going forward.
I would like also to note that we have official engaged IR firm IMS in order to achieve broader investor awareness and educate the investment community on our key business development and growth objectives moving forward.
I will now turn the call over to Yuval to review our business. Yuval, please go ahead."

Unidentified Analyst ,1,Good morning. I know a big focus of the company has been to diversify revenue outside of Israel. Can you give us a sense of what percentage of consolidated revenues from outside of Israel for the quarter compared to one year ago and approximately three years ago?
Eyal Cohen,1,"Thank you for the question. I will take this question, Eyal. Our revenues outside of Israel have grown consistently over the years from approximately 20% in 2014 we grow to a degree to 25% in 2017 and in the first quarter it was higher, it was about --in the first quarter of 2018 it was something like a 26%. And currently our major market outside of Israel is the Far East, India as you can see in our recent press releases.
Thank you."
Operator,1,The next question is from Mike Hussey of Katamon Capital. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst ,1,Good morning. My understanding is that the business has relatively decent visibility into your revenues. I was wondering if you might be able to provide us with a rough sense of what percentage of your 2018 $29 million revenue guidance is actually booked at this point in time.
Yuval Viner ,1,"Thank you for the question, it's Yuval. Out of the $29 million revenue for year 2018, we booked about $17 million at the end of June. In addition major portion of our RFID and Mobile division revenue, it's from repeat orders from our existing customers for lab services, consumables such as RFID tag and ongoing inventory counting service. Hence, we are confident that we will exceed the $29 million revenue in year 2018."

Tom Forte,1,Yes regarding the pilot program that you announced in February with the self scanning solution at the food retailer there. Can you give an update on how that pilot program is progressing and if you expect this to be a new growing line of business for you?
Yuval Viner,1,"It's Yuval. The pilot with self scanning with the major retailer in Israel; we just started in a few stores. We exam that with the management of all the team that lead this project, and we at this moment don't know exactly about number of stores and how it will grow the business on this vertical market. But there is a good feeling, good feedback first from the end-user and second from the management team. So we feel comfortable still I can't give the numbers but there is a good wave of doing the business on this specific vertical market."
