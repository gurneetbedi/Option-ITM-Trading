Liv Garfield,0,"Good morning, everyone. I am Liv Garfield, Chief Executive of Severn Trent and welcome to the Severn Trent's '18, '19 half year results. And joining on stage are James Bowling, our CFO and I've got members of the executive team who are eagerly awaiting questions at the end of the presentation.
So it's been a busy six months. We've submitted not one, but two year '19 business plans. We've been able to put up all the stocks that cope with increased demand over very hot summer. We've continued to really strong progress on our financing strategy. We feel good about our the pattern and looking forward into the next half of financing.
With Agrivert, an acquisition which will continue to bolster our green energy business. And we're proud to have been announced and acknowledged as a Pathfinder Company of the Purposeful Company and I'll talk a little bit about that in a bit more detail.
Now James has got all the numbers right now but one little number I thought I just throw out as a reflection to start it as when you look at the underlying EPS growth of 0.16 and that gives an EPS and earnings per share of 76.2 roofing that reflects the strong operational and will supply for us over the last period of time.
And with that, let's get James to take us through the numbers."
James Bowling,0,"Thank you, Liv and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to be reporting a good set of financial results for the first six months of this year. So let's turn to the highlights.
With group turnover up 3.6%, we've delivered PBIT growth of 4.3% or £12.4 million. This increased profit is after absorbing an extra £10 million of operating costs in the hot dry summer and is supported by £80 million of gains from the sale of land in Nottingham that I mentioned in May, giving us a good start on our ambition of delivering £100 million of property profits over the decade to 2027.
On financing, our effective interest rate has fallen 70 basis points to 3.8% as we worked hard to fund the lowest available rates for new and refinanced debt and benefited from slightly lower inflation.
Taken together, we've delivered a 16% increase in underlying earnings per share, providing good cover by entering dividend, which is up almost 8% on last year, reflecting fixed dividend policy of RPI plus growth of 4%.
As we've announced at the full year results in May, we're now managing and reporting our bio-resources and property development activity within business services. To help you navigate through this transition year, I'll be showing comparatives on the old segmental basis with a bridge to the new basis of reporting. So let's turn to regulated water and wastewater.
Turnover for this our largest segment grew by 4% overall, mainly driven by the RPI linked tariff increases in Severn Trent and have doubled of 28 million. Customer ODIs of 8 million that we have own for outperformance in '16, '17, have been partially offset by the same year with an adjustment, that true up billing over the five-year final determination.
Another smooth differences including the impact of new connections and meter options with the total increase for the year to £33 million. As I mentioned we've included on this side of bridge to our new basis of reporting that shows the movement of revenue, out of regulated water and wastewater for those activities now managed in our business services segment.
Let's now turn to PBIT. We held underlying PBIT for our regulated water and wastewater business broadly flat as the higher turnover I mentioned previously was offset by an increase in net operating expenses. Now in May I guided you to expect an increase in power costs in environment agency fees, but I didn’t forecast the glorious weather we saw over the summer months. And while not exceptional, the hot dry wet spell did significantly increase our customer's demand for water.
And as you can see from this slide, most of the £10 million of extra cost to meet this, were in hired and contracted services and power. In the second half, we'll be absorbing a similar amount of additional costs for operational recovery, which I'll touch on later.
Going through some of the larger movements, net labor and hired and contracted costs combined were up £10.5 million. Absent the hot weather, combined costs were up around 2% as the annual payer reward and higher headcount were partially offset by higher split of our work allocated to capital programs this year.
Power cost increased by €5.3 million year-on-year due to higher pas through rates as previously guided and the cost of pumping more water during the summer. Our bad debt charge increased by £2.5 million and we're currently providing a 2.1% of households turnover slightly better than the 2.2% for last year.
And finally depreciation was 5% higher as we wrote down the value of retiring assets being replaced this year and also see the proportion of investment in innovative shorter life technology assets increase.
So turning now to our Business Services segment. It's been an exciting year for our non-regulated business. The sale of land in Nottingham at the start of this year generated a profit of £18 million and will enable a 830 new homes to be built by the developer.
We're nearing completion of our acquisition of Agrivert, which will add five food waste and our EBITDA just in plants to our portfolio generating equivalent of 106 gigawatt hours per annum. Agrivert brings with it significant management expertise, secure long-term contracts and 20-year renewal energy subsidies, all of which make it a great fit for existing food waste business.
On a like-for-like business services turnover and PBIT are marginally down this half as we're lapping a busy period last year on the MOD contract and absorbed start-up costs on our new derby food waste plants, which will be operational in the second half. However, we expect turnover and PBIT both to be up for the full year.
So turning now to cash flow and net debt. We generated cash from operations of €490 million and we reinvested much of this in capital projects with CapEx spend up 70 million this half year to €340 million as planned. Work on projects such as the Birmingham Resilience program upgrades to our waste assets as part of the water framework directive and improves such processing in our new THP sites.
I mean the 2018, '19 will be Severn Trent's biggest year of capital investment in the last decade. After counting for tax interest, dividends and other items, net debt increased by €62 million of the period.
So let's now turn to our financing performance. It's been a good year so far as the balanced financing strategy we followed since 2015 has delivered further significant reductions in our finance costs, down €17 million this half year. Our effective interest rate for the first half is down to 3.8%, a 70 basis points lower than last year.
This reduction is driven by a number of factors. First, we replaced expensive fixed rate debt such as our 6%, €400 million bond, which matured in January with new low-cost debt. Second, through our balanced debt mix, we've continued to benefit from the lower interest rate environment, the new funding. And third, we've seen lower inflation this year, which has helped reduce the inflation roll up on the quarter of our debt portfolio is index linked.
We expect our full year effective rate to be slightly higher at around 4% due to higher inflation expected in the second half.
So turning to our debt portfolio, we accessed the U.S. private placement market this year and raised £323 million across a range of maturities between 10 and 20 years, which we fixed at current low rates. We delayed drawing down the funds until this month so they are not reflected in our interim accounts. And the placement takes the total funding raised in AMP6 to £3.3 billion and gives us liquidity out to early 2021.
Our regulatory gearing was 59% to the half year and as a reminder we typically see gearing dip slightly at the interims due to higher bill receipts in the first half and our interest payments in the second. And we still expect to exit the AMP with gearing levels close to the PR19 notional level of 60% which will position us well for the start of AMP7.
We continue to closely carefully monitor market conditions and our interest rate exposure. Roughly half of our portfolios at fixed rates and quarter each is in floating and index linked.
We’re confident we have the right balance of flexibility and financial resilience for the future. On pensions actuarial gains and other adjustments in the period reduce our deficit to 466 million. Note that this figure doesn’t reflect any potential liabilities relating to the equalization of the guaranteed minimum pension which we’re working on with our advisors and the trustees and expect to recognize in the second half.
So finally let's turn to our technical guidance for the full year. I leave you to read through the detail but there are a couple of points I want to highlight. We’re forecasting higher energy pass through costs and EA license fees to continue through the second half of the year.
As I mentioned earlier, the activity to meet customer demands during the hot weather cost around £10 million in July and August which is being fully reflected in our first half results. We’re forecasting a similar amount of spend on operational recovery after the event in the second half and – which we expect to resolve through ongoing efficiencies to leave our guidance across operating cost and RoRE unchanged.
We continue to expect a neutral position on customers ODIs for year four based on the current incentive cap on waste ODIs. Now as you know earlier this year we applied to offer a little cap on waste ODIs. On the 1st of November Ofwat published a consultation documents relating to the application.
We’re assessing the proposal they have outlined and we’ll respond this week so we’ll updated the market and if necessary our guidance following the consultation phase. The rest of our guidance remains unchanged.
And with that I'll hand over to Liv."
Liv Garfield,0,"Thank you, James. And it is his birthday, so thank you for spending the day with all of us today on his birthday.
So then and we're set out in 2015 but we absolutely wanted to make sure that our vision was to be a most trusted company in our sector. And we knew that in order to do that we asked our customers what would that look like and they shared that would need to be fantastic value for money, environmental leadership and great service.
And we knew in order to achieve those ambitions we have to really work for all of our stakeholders, our customers, our colleagues, our investors and also our communities.
And to that matter and the effort we’ve put into this, we were so pleased with the most recent independent tracker to see that we are now the most trusted company in England in our sector and it fears like it’s really in the DNA of our company and it puts us in a really strong position for the future.
Now trust, you have to earn it. You have to maintain it. It does feel as though as we head forth with that sense of trust and societal purpose is something which we are really believing is a key part of the future.
And the way we view this is we view the fact that to be the very best Severn Trent we can be is built on a culture of trust with all of those various stakeholders.
We also been good for the stakeholders. We believe that sense of trust to the heart is good for customers. It's good for colleagues. It’s good for the environment. We actually believe for investors it creates value as well for the long-term. So that’s why we’ve made two changes for our presentation set for today.
You have noticed on your seats not only do you have the beautifully crafted slides from the IR team, would take you to the results, but you also have a lovely document if you have that later and in that document you will see a whole heap of concrete examples that try to bring to light the effort and the outputs, which have led to us being acknowledged as a pathfinder company in this purpose of space, the only utility to be acknowledged as a pathfinder.
You've also see hopefully on the way in that we've actually also begun to evidence how we are performing against 11 of the 17 UN sustainable goals. And what you’re going to see in a second or two as I flip on my side is you're going to see little icons and those icons reference we're making efforts and delivery things against a sustainable UN goals. It’s a real passion for us on these so that we can talk about more that maybe bring out a sense in our business to make it more visible to yourselves.
So with that let’s go on PR19, we couldn’t possibly have a presentation and not have one slide on it you would definitely have missed it. So we submitted our plan we feel our plan is robust, it’s balanced, it’s ambitious. We think that it matches the needs of our customers and also all regulators. And to remind you of what some of our plan is it’s based first of all on a 5% bill reduction which is the largest in two decades and continues to make ours the lowest bills in the land through to 2025 both in England and in Wales.
It also predicated the Severn Trent plan on a 13% reduction in cost and that actually we believe depending on the mode offer chooses we’ll see as upper quartile in waste water and retail. It’s got the largest RCV growth any of the listed it’s based on the fact that it got strong financing sustainable backbone through it with the credit we are seeing, the dividend policy or the gearing.
And officially it has the largest of the bull ranges on ODIs and that’s because we absolutely embrace incentivization we have in this five year period we absolutely want the same in the next five year period. And that's not long until we get our feedback 31st of January is date which will give us that initial mark of our plan and we’ll enforce that date. In the meantime we’re clear on is that our stakeholders what they absolutely want to suggest prepare ourselves to be in the strongest possible shape to start on Severn.
We make sure that journey is already started and continues so as we arrive into year 2019 we are in the right shape preparing to go and that’s what we as a management team are focused on delivering.
So let's move on and think about what have we learned for the whole customer research we just recently been involved in. We done domestic strength of customer research in our history and that’s given us peaks of insights which helps us create even better Severn Trent for the future.
We have now got a brilliant community, an online chat community of 15,000 customers that have already reached dialogue with us and can give us real time insights in what they are thinking, how they are feeling, answer questions for us on where we should go next on particular topics.
We also feel good about the fact that actually when you look at the two big customer experience metrics in AMP7 D-MeX and C-MeX. When you look at the current metrics its most closely matched to those measures we’re actually upper quartile on those metrics today which can give us a strong start to go into AMP7.
And as you can see here we are really excited about new innovations that are coming out that how we engage with customers. And one thing we went live over the summer was the opportunity for customers to face time life to our engineers.
To raise a problem and to actually show that problem live so we’re almost waiting to go out instead customers get real-time diagnosis and is weakened to play our resource over the light activities it’s really popular customers and it’s a quicker time to fix typically on the issue and of course it’s much effective and to end-to-end as on process that’s an example of some of the new technology begins to play now to get ourselves in that total tip top shape ready for AMP7.
So let’s start by talking about Water, so we have continued to make good progress of course the last and we getting ourselves ready to be in the right shape as we enter AMP7.
On water quality complaints when we talked about the last couple of years we have made a further progress we are confident this year of improvement by 6% which is based on last year’s 12% reduction again in water quality complaints and we still believe that we are in good shape we’re in the war territory by the end of next year ex in the AMP in strong shape in water quality complaints.
We got a laser like focus on the pitch and with the find to fix activity with his new innovations that we’re scanning the world to bring in we know we’ve got a really ambitious 15 cent target next AMP and our mind is very focused on getting ourselves into the right position for that bigger AMP7 challenge.
And one things we haven’t talked about as much but it’s kind of perfect timing is we have done a whole heap of work in the environmental arena and actually we got some of the team here today that you can try to afterwards and it’s the opportunity for suppose to really change behavior of farmers.
We had the scale and we have been working with farmers called Farm to Tap, and we’ve been educating and working we have changed the behaviors of 800 farmers over the last few years. The question means is that we work with them on how to make their colleges deliver better, how to make sure that we actually spend less money on treatment processes, supporting them and our farming methods. And the great news is that's gone really well and actually is now an opportunity to see it but also earn to £11 million ODI awards at the end of AMP4 for our performance in that catchment area.
As James mentioned earlier we have seen some absolutely glorious weather and of course that brings with it some challenges for us to manage during the course of the summer. And we’re really pleased with how we manage that position. We have the reservoirs at 98% capacity went into it in a strong position to be able to manage the 22% increase in demand that customer drove the peak moments.
We’re on track to still improve on our supply interruption year-on-year performance. We said we halved that this year and we’re on track with that performance which again is a good improvements. And I think when James mentioned earlier, it will cost you money.
If you have a situation like that whether it’s just a step changing customer demand more activity to get across the business. And of course it will cost us and we sold to £10 million of cost for the first half of the year for the second half of the year we manage to rebalance water around the network to make sure an exact public place to enter into another summer. And that’s why there will be a further cost allegation the second half again which will swallow in normal operating cost.
Now moving to waste we believe we truly excel in this part of the sector and if you cross compare factor performance in this AMP, whether its ODIs or it’s our cost base would have been frontier, it’s our environmental performance which showed last three years. We have enforced our status by coveted EA rating.
We think we have demonstrated we’re really leaders in the waste part of our business. And we don’t talk enough I think about how we deliver that its only places that cash could work. So quite simply we have through the best asset models in the sector.
And that allows us the data to understand where we’re going to put our efforts. It means by using the culture the performance culture that we embedded through the climate of ODIs with the telemetry having across our network combine together we intercept we then prevent and we really make sure that we got this really good virtual circle of activity, the limit customer paying and creating much stronger environmental performance. And in fact sense that we think is right to the heart of why we do well in waste water.
Now we recently asked our customers what they would like for the future and they came back strongly with a real push on that they really care customer about this cost of our organization. And that’s why we’ve continued to make sure our AMP7 plan practice that and strongly.
We’ve got the largest ODI range on waste measures we’ve also made sure on the key measures that you can’t supersize we’ve supersized both of those and we’ve also listen to our customers quite carefully and included that both ODIs were not done before but our customers have said they have really passionate about seeing progress in our space. We got strong momentum and strong progress in AMP6 on this area and we feel good of the challenges in AMP7.
So let me just touch now on our people so if the culture of Severn Trent’s that we think make special organization and it’s has been a jammed packed people agenda over the last period of time. our people will generally proud of that and once again we were named in the social mobility index.
It’s a real passion for us 30% of the nation’s cold spots places where you’ve born you got less chance of getting on with your career in the Severn Trent match. And we have a huge opportunity here to really influence the lives of people in our region for the better. And we appraised thought of that for the work that we’re doing specifically on recruitment in those cold spots.
Equally we like to kind of tranquilize on top a little bit more to do in the work force and that might menopause and it might be mental health, and perhaps your chancellor earlier we talked about that 70% of our line managers have been educating Trent in how to really engage on mental health topics and it really made a difference culture what I think is a business topic that effects every business today.
And just last week we were named once again at the top four in the nation for the Alexander Report. We were the top utility again for the second year running and this I guess is testimony to the fact that we are passionate about diverse inclusion.
As a senior team there is having a female we really strongly believe that it’s the obligation of us to create footprints for others to walk in to try and make sure this becomes a much more normal diverse mix across all sectors and across the UK.
And many of you got the chance to come along with 900 of our line managers to the truly immersed and Seven experience in September which I hope you enjoyed it certainly created a huge buzz internally. More we’re looking to do with that because in our workforce really excited about AMP7. To get lined up with 18 months to go they knew where the challenges were they knew where the ambitions were and to get ourselves pointing in the right direct with ample time to get ready for the next five year regulatory period.
With that let me summarize methodology of summarizing it just to contextualize before we get to Q&A the whole last three and a half years for three and a half year then what are the five year journey. And we started here really passionate about saying have been shouldered our bills are the lowest for the future.
What can we do on efficiencies to drive that long-term ambition for our customers? And I mean we have identified £870 million worth of business savings which we’re proud of. We also went live with a new financing strategy which has paid off well and got us in a strong place UQ for the next period.
We then also said to ourselves we want to make sure we achieve really good things for our customers and our communities we passionate about and that’s what so far have landed strongly for all three years of the last three within the AMP4 ODIs and that’s to measure that customers care about most.
We have also made some good progress with some of the customer topics and made sure that we’ve got the environmental post our status achieve with the last three years. And then it’s about planning for the future I mean we have done decent job in this end what’s on the next phase how do we get ourselves ready for the long-term in Severn Trent’s.
And that’s why we have reinvested £220 million for the future to make sure on areas where we know we can do better with exactly the right shape. We’re pleased to be showing today but actually our self generation would actually have achieve this by year the acquisition of Agrivert would actually achieve 50% by 2019 which is a year ahead of target and put us in good shape for that agenda.
And we are now forecasting and 8.9% RCV growth during the course of company period. And all of these efforts cumulatively have gained us an upper quartile position in RoRE for the first three years of the AMP at 9.3%. Now a year ago I told you about the fact that we are reorganization internally and we thought will get us in better shape in the future.
That’s landed well but again gets us with the momentum of our results in this AMP the reorganization that we did last year that we can get in the perfect shape of future we feel as though we’re ready and we ready to go as begin to move out of AMP6 and towards AMP7.
With that we’re going to take Q&A I am going to ask five members of my team to come and join us here and we’ll who has got some questions for us. Right so we got mic and you have a mic on questions. Yeah I knew you guys are going [indiscernible] question is asked oh sorry you’re next."
Q - James Brand,1,"James Brand from Deutsche Bank. Just one question and it’s on Brexit so sorry about that and I also asked very similar question yesterday to United Utilities, but I'm interested your view because obviously e-legislations has been very important in driving environmental regulations in the UK and can effects water for long time. We’re starting to get a bit small visibility on what Brexit might look like with the graft withdrawal agreement and the physical declaration.
So just wondering whether you have any views at this stage whether you felt like you have more visibility on who would be setting the rules going forward what they might look like there were no regression provisions I believe in the withdrawal PT so maybe does some insight knows and it’s not going to be the EU whether you had any initial discussions with the UK government over what they might think environmental regulations for such?"
Liv Garfield,1,"Great so let’s hope I give a similar answer I guess to the your answer yesterday so the way that this is set it actually between now and 2027 the regulations were actually outlined quite clearly but they are already a strong overlooking period where we know exactly what is that we need to deliver as a sector and as an organization.
And that’s actually something that’s been always good for us in the last I guess couple of decades as a sector is that environmental obligations arrived and set the future. So it’s part of PR19 we are committing to the next I guess you said for today six years of our lives in that environmental space.
Looking that beyond that the conversations that we had with Jeff from the U.K. government is that there is real pride quite rightly in the nation perhaps why we have come as a sector in the last 20 years in the environments. And we need those customers that passion about the environment being even more important going forward.
So I think what we’re going to get a sense of that the UK government wants to hold on to that crown of having made such progress whether it’s was quality whether its features, whether it’s green spaces by diversity. So I think that they are even more encouraged with going forward with good investment in our space."
Mark Freshney,1,"Hello it’s Mark Freshney from Credit Suisse, I have two questions firstly on the new business segment business services specifically property. You’re reporting profits within there but my understanding is some of those profits go back to consumers through the regulatory process rather than being retained for shareholders.
So can you give some clarity surrounding the accounting there and specifically whether shareholders will actually benefit from any of that? And my second question is on the 2.8 billion sterling pension obligation and the court ruling I think last month.
Can you give us some kind of indication on how many scheme members or what proportion of the scheme members might be impacted so we could start to think about what the impact on the 2.8 billion liability might be?"
Liv Garfield,1,And both definitely great question James.
James Bowling,1,"Yes right okay so on the accounting all property profit so I think a couple of presentations that we kind of laid out how that would work. And there is an appendix that we did I think about a year ago it shows that but broadly think of it like this, what goes through as PBIT will get shared with customers.
So think about it as being around 50-50 of what we show will go back to customers in the form of an adjustment to RCV at the end of each AMP period. So that’s how the mechanics of it work."
Liv Garfield,1,Oh thank you for the details.
James Bowling,1,Yeah.
Liv Garfield,1,"The PBIT number stays. It's an RCB adjustment over 20 year journey, but we’ll send over to you so won’t miss that Mark so we’ll get it over to you later."
James Bowling,1,"Second one don’t have percentages scheme members I am afraid we are obviously working through this is sort of live issue that all companies with define benefit plans are working through. I think the general view is and this is a general view that the GMP equalization could be around 1% of the overall level of liabilities because I said I can’t give you a definitive number.
Now for us it will be very much dependent on scheme rules and how we as the sponsor and the trustee interpret those and how we implement it. And my expectation is that we have some numbers that we can incorporate into our balance sheet in May."
Liv Garfield,1,And we’ll get his queries [indiscernible].
Iain Turner,1,"It’s Iain Turner from Exane, can you be the most trusted water company in England if you miss your leakage target?"
Liv Garfield,1,"Sometimes that you can because the most recent independent tracker says that we were the most trusted water company for the last six months and yeah for the first time in many years we did just missed our leakage target last year. And is the leakage important to customers massively is it something that we work really hard on every year to make sure we deliver yes.
But I am actually customers view your entire performance across a whole range of measures. They judge you on like money on environmental leadership and on customer service and it’s the combined that gives you that sense, brilliant."
Nigel Hawkins,1,"Nigel Hawkins, Hardman some months ago when you put in plan – they appear to have given up on trying to get an improvement on 2.4% WAC. When you put in your plan you can see if it's effectively given 2.4%. Are you going to try and persuade Ofwat to increase it we are always using those CBI phrase, going on a bare knuckle fight with Ofwat to get that figure percentage increase?"
Liv Garfield,1,Do I talk about how we handle I guess you know I suppose relationship which is not a bare knuckle fight? We tend to get more constructive dialogue you want to give sense of that.
James Bowling,1,"Yes I think that the key is we put a plan in - that in round we obviously think is financeable as Liv said we think it's a robust ambitious plan. I don’t think it’s appropriate first of kind of commenting on how we kind of engaging with – around that particular issue.
We factored a number that they published early into our financial models and then worked around that to ensure that the package that we got is as I say financeable and robust. And we have to remember after all that we did as a sector. We want Ofwat to put the numbers out early in the process. So that we could effectively deliver plans it in the round we weren’t waiting for us to pronounce on a WAC number later on in the process. So I think that gives you a sense of where we come at this from."
Nigel Hawkins,1,"Just on that issue, perhaps on the FD, could you just reconcile the 4% interest cost your projecting for this full year with the debt component of what forward 2.4% of WAC proposal?"
James Bowling,1,It looks good so if you break down the debt elements of AMP7 allowance I think they expect that the embedded debt portion of that will be around 4.6% on a normal basis. So we’re up 4% which I think looks good and I think we need to look at what their forecasting for you new debt so I think that the kind of recent issuances as we have done compare favorably to that as well. So I'm confident that we’re in the right place going into about seven in terms of our balance debt strategy.
Liv Garfield,1,And we have taken a good number years together so I think an Ofwat view to the sector they look an average across the sector and we had to work hard to get ourselves from being a less good performer and adding up a quarter in that space.
Nigel Hawkins,1,"Can I ask a question about your business plan? you seem very upbeat about it and should we assume that you also on to be fast tracked Ofwat unlike we there to save the chance of Thames and Bristol Water being fast tracked, certainly not odds-on -- you're odds-on, don't you think?"
Liv Garfield,1,"So Nigel I am at most positive optimistic person you ever meet so there is no way I would ever do a presentation I am optimistic about live so you should assume this is just my normal demeanor. It's that enter every meeting in a positive manner.
So you should not interpret anything from the fact that I am smiley cheerful soul that just me on a normal day. So we’ve submitted worst ambitious balance plan of good number I am sure of really good plans to look at. While we have to going to wait till 31st of January to get any new music from it."
Nigel Hawkins,1,So confident but not complaining?
Liv Garfield,1,"No, no just naturally cheerful definitely not so definitely giving you no wording I am saying I am a naturally cheerful soul don’t interpret cheerful voice tone to mean any insight."
Nigel Hawkins,1,Good.
Liv Garfield,1,Right.
Timothy Ho,1,"Yeah it’s Timothy Ho from Morgan Stanley and couple of questions from the first is on the potential and company of the ODIs from Ofwat and when do expect to have among that and can give any more color about kind of your view on that consultation.
And secondly on the dividend as we get in towards this is planning final determination what is timing will be on policy and what will be the key kind of drivers in your decision-making on dividend when you think post 2020? Thanks."
Liv Garfield,1,"We’ve always said we wouldn’t and share anything on dividend former policy to last December 2019 because you need to get final WAC calculation and that won’t come out in the wash until the very end. So that remains exactly the same and we've also got dividend policy of not really talking about consultations when they are live because they are that in consultation.
So we will submit since this week and Ofwat world to a final conclusion on the 12th of December and as James said we’ll definitely share with everybody what comes out at that stage but it’s pretty best managed on the 12th of December which is a real shame I feel bad on answering all of your questions in any detail and obviously take another question the third one, but I feel guilty now."
Mark Freshney,1,"Mark Freshney from Credit Suisse, can I please ask on the debtors aging I mean it’s pretty tough out there on the high streets for instance. You alluded in the statement some of the older debt balance is being difficult to collect. Could you give us a quantum of that and how you see collection in general?"
Liv Garfield,1,Great so I’ll get Sarah in second just to give some insight as to what we’re doing to keep focused on collection. James do you want to give any further information on aged debt or have we given enough?
James Bowling,1,"We look at the sort of the debt profile overall the key thing – the good news of takeaway is that when you look at actual performance year-on-year on a like for like basis when you're adjust for the increase in revenue we are actually collecting £13 million more cash than we did last year which is good.
The mix is slightly different so we are collecting higher amount better faster amounts from more recent debt which I think in the long-term bodes well because there is less going out into the old buckets.
But we are seeing it being slightly slower collecting some older debt it is a smaller part of the overall debt portfolio but that hasn’t meant that I have decided to be a bit more prudent with that debt and to keep our provisioning at around about the same levels we had last year.
So that’s I think it's tougher there for some people. I think that's why we’ve seen a good take up for our big different scheme and we are committing to help even more customers in AMP7 because we recognize that for some folk they do find it difficult to pay their bills."
Liv Garfield,1,Sarah?
Sarah Bentley,1,"Yeah obviously I mean I think – for this quite a while now we've got sort two basic clause kind of a very targeted sophisticated data based analytic way of dealing with people who won’t pay and a very empathetic caring and supportive way of dealing with people who can’t pay.
And we’re got a very, very clear track if I look at some of the progress we are making James talked about the newer debt, getting much more sophisticated in the data sharing that we are doing but then also the analytics that we are doing on top of that to sort of micro segment people who won’t pay its different categories and take the appropriate debt strategy for them.
So all the groundwork that we've talked about is really paying AMP of in terms of our space and I'm also just massively delighted we talked about our social purpose all the way the care and assistance team which is constantly leaping - acknowledged as a leading in this space working with a range of different charities extending this scheme I can't tell you how delighted I am but all of the engagement we did through PR19 and shown a massive step up in the support that we got broadly from our customers space to support people who are struggling financially.
So I'm kind of I am excited about the progress that we are making and I'm really enthusiastic about the support we've got fans going forward."
Verity Mitchell,1,"Verity Mitchell, HSBC just a question about whether the dry summer changed any of your thinking and for the next AMP. And also just an update on the reinvestment the 220 million is that very much the things that you plan to do has it been any variation and have you been showing that with Ofwat?"
Liv Garfield,1,"Very good. So I'll get Helen and James involved in these as well. So the great thing about organization like ours is you're constantly paying for the very long-term as well planning for the near term. It’s being as exciting about a water utility is the chance to look at multiple different horizons. And one think that we had while we said two things that will change respect to our climate change and population growth.
They have been long-term challenges we talk about and I think what we see in the summer is a little bit of that play game but we already had some really good long-term plans. It also given us some opportunity this year to kind of who uses the most water now in dry situation we don’t all use the same – different in ways all different people and actually we’ve got extra insight this summer which has helped us with some local stuff as well. So James can you talk about our long-term ambition on kind of supply demand."
James Bowling,1,"Yes thanks Liv, so I think it worth bearing in mind that going into the summer we are in a really position. So I think Liv referenced at start we’re 98% in our road water reservoirs and the challenge here in the summer was been able to treat that water effectively and get through ours into the distribution network at the right in which people are using it. We’ve got an extensive plan for resilience in AMP7 and that’s building our account resilience profile that we got today.
But of the back of December what we’ve been able to do is really look across our areas and look at local resilient issues and how we improve that resiliency in those particular areas. So for instance what we’ve done in one area is we brought a new water source packing supply that provides an additional 2.5 million liters of water day into that particular area and once we got through in that area during the summer through tankering systems, what that will mean is we won't effectively need two tankers in the future.
So we are not only improving resilience across our network but we are also reducing the cost of these sorts of events and the impact that they have on our OpEx and going forward in the future. And these are things we are doing as well and looking at the things like our own internal tankering capability.
So again we did and James alluded to the cost that we spend on hard and contracted back and just reduces our cost going forward in the future to say. So we are expecting more of these events. We are confident that we can deal with these sorts of events in the future we know that they will come again it higher that we just make sure that going forward we’ll continue to maintain and build on that resilience across cost at the same time."
Liv Garfield,1,Great and Helen for 220 million that we are investing in the future do you want to give feel or examples I guess overall how we are doing and some examples?
Helen Miles,1,"Yes so there was 120 million that we committed to a while ago on vulnerable customers water quality and security and a large proportion of that money is being spent we’re well on with that program that’s going to be well.
And then back in May we announced further investment of 100 million that bill early days we identified what we’re spending the money on say you recall our academy which is a key part of our AMP7 plan also monitoring and logging of our networks.
So, we’re well into way with that and also an asset in our key site and part of what James is talking about is some of the investment we pushing in that. So that still early days and we will be spending majority of that money over the next 12 months."
Liv Garfield,1,Follow on question.
Verity Mitchell,1,So follow-on question is and so how do you report that off – what you just go ahead and spend it or do you run it past them to start with because they're quite material amounts of money?
Liv Garfield,1,"No so the regime is outfit based regime. So Ofwat would hold our feet to the fire through our performance quite rightly on all the matters. And whether that make it to our assets are in the right shape for the future or whether that ODIs which are converting interim full measures they will hold off to that and to us as a senior team to make sure that we are focused on the short to medium and long-term in the right manner and managing our balance.
So it is for us to make the right decisions in different time horizons they will hold us, quite rightly, feet to the fire for the results. Great other question."
Nigel Hawkins,1,"Nigel Hawkins, Hardman again two questions I expect one for each of you. First of all on the land sell which I think if I remember was the Persimmon, I see the profit number. I don't see the sales proceed number so just wondered whether you could let us know how much you actually got from selling that land.
And secondly your Dee Valley acquisition, I wondered whether that is going to loss waste and water acquisition you’re going to make in the UK I think Bristol, which has had a checkered career in recent years. And also I am old enough to remember when one of your predecessors said he is launching a bid for South West Water. Is Dee Valley the last? Or should we expect other municipalities expanding your core business?"
Liv Garfield,1,"And the second one quickly, whilst James and Andy decide to talk about the [indiscernible] close deal. So we never debate M&A strategy but right now I can share our plan is to get ourselves in good shape AMP7 and Dee Valley was a good buy for us because we thought we could make a better answer for customers there.
We thought economically it would provide us the synergies and we're pleased with the other 20% synergies that we have achieved, but as importantly, we had license and we thought are strategically important to us.
But for reasons across a range of our SD value was a good situation. Right now attention is on AMP7 preparation and getting ourselves in the right shape. James, do you want to talk about surplus."
James Bowling,1,It's around £21 million of the proceeds.
Unidentified Analyst,1,"Do you feel constrained by current legislation on expending the core business because the groceries we may end up with two groceries and market share between them seem odd if water is limited having one, we said more in 15%."
Liv Garfield,1,"So I feel at the moment that each Chief Executive see a team focus on whether you're going to create best value right now and when I look at the back through '18 going forward, I think of what created an exciting regime that will have one in business and our focus is on making sure that we went up in AMP7, so I feel as though that's what as I said and we feel good about the right focus."
Unidentified Analyst,1,Thank you.
Liv Garfield,1,"Sorry we missed out, my apologies. "
Deborah Gilshan,1,"Thank you. And my name Deborah Gilshan. I'm from Aberdeen Standard Investments. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about culture within Severn Trent, but also mentioned that leasing placing Severn Trent and so how you're using divestiture including gender diversity as a strategic imperative rather than a nice half? Thank you."
Liv Garfield,1,"And we believe passionately in diverse in inclusion right across the whole organization for different backgrounds, for different ethnicity different, for different genders. So we're not just actually the general diversity. We believe that the best cultures and everybody feel they can do the very best they can and that means they feel totally includes it and it even sells every day.
That's our belief and as such we believe you get the right footprints and people will follow. So it's not about motive, it's not about driving towards the particular result, it's about creating the right culture and actually the results just follow. We never set out to be a Hampton-Alexander leader. We happened to be the leader on the basis that we've got to increase the field in the company and that has ended up with that results.
The types of things that we do to get the right culture is first of all, we got to be accessible and we have the senior team spend their week and then longer with teams trying to really make sure that we're listening. So top to bottom across the organization. We think that's important.
We believe that celebrating success is important. So we're quite passionate about that. So for example we have not big things like big prices, but we are actually asked colleagues to pay nominate each other. So we had last year we had about 5,000 colleagues nominating another peer just for thank you it's got a brilliant and it's a rare moment to celebrate and we're done well.
We try to get to build topics to be taboo, so manifolds, for example. Last week was out on a Friday and I was just on the floor cleaning a cabinet getting site DWI ready, and this lovely apprentice, he was like about 20 he said, Liv, are you perimenopausal? And I almost bashed that head out. But the truth was he's just been on his menopause training and he's desperate to got to do and there was just this lovely moment that we've managed to really but actually this entire stoppage you should have come it was always moment of anxiety.
We try to create a much more I guess informal organization. So it doesn’t feel the same and that's the type of things we try to do and the way that we can know we can progress is because our engagement scores are we can see that we're six times ahead of the efforts in the U.K. and Ireland and we can see that one of the real improvement across the whole organization. There are other types of things that we price ourselves and that's what we try to focus on."
Unidentified Analyst,1,"So this is very personal question and just on corporate overheads, just a reflection of their increasing diversity of your business and how should we think of that going forward?"
James Bowling,1,"Yeah remember that within that millions of corporate, we've absorbed around 3 million of the kind of the cost of Agrivert acquisition that you'll see the benefits over the second half of the year."
Liv Garfield,1,I mean that that's been incorporated. So actually it can give you a bit of a false number because…
James Bowling,1,It's not moving significantly going forward will be my view.
Liv Garfield,1,"And actually, we believe -- to get ready for AMP7, one of the things we've said openly is we need to make sure that we are from seven and that means really making sure that we drive ourselves to be effective and we will parts for our business corporate overheads being more of the areas we got to be cost effective, those are probably masked number based on the acquisition. Right again, we have two more questions."
Mark Nelson,1,"Just on the sorry, Mark Nelson from Killik & Co. Just on the property profits, I think I am right in saying that you want to make £100 million over the next decade. So £80 million puts you ahead of that on a run rate basis. Should we expect that to be frontloaded or are you just going to slowdown as we move over the next decade."
Liv Garfield,1,[indiscernible] will answer that question.
Unidentified Company Representative,1,"We said the deal closes on one of our bigger sites, so that is quite exceptional. So we expect it to be steady over the next period eight years we've got left. As we've guided, it will be up and down we've said between 5 million and 50 million and we expect to keep it in that range.
We've got a good set of properties in the pipeline. Julie and the team are set we're engaged with the right people and the right planning process. Our promotion partners are working well. So we'll see some variation, but by and large it will be steady throughout the rest of the year."
Liv Garfield,1,I think we are now completed that and further Q&A. Well thank you very much for coming today. Much appreciated and we'll see you at the end of the year.
