Nir Sztern,0,"Thank you, Ehud. Good day to all of you, and welcome to our third quarter 2018 results conference call.
During the third quarter, we continued to grow in the fixed-line segment, while at the same time focused on building and developing future growth engines for Cellcom Israel; I’ll discuss these in a few moments. On the cellular side, the market remains tough for all players. The competitive environment in the mobile sector remains tough and can be seen by the continued decline in service revenues in the current quarter.
In early November, we announced the change to our pricing model of several packages offered to our customers, launching a number of new and simple packs? These include an increase in pricing along with an increase in the packages content without a built-in price increase at the end of the first year as was typical until now. We continue to be the market leader in over-the-top TV in Israel and our strategy continues to be a success. As of today, we have 213,000 households subscribe to our television service; our market share stands at around 12%.
In the third quarter, we continued to invest in the viewing experience of our customers and we added new sports content as well as content for children. We offer our customers TV services, together with Internet, cellular and fixed-line services, making up a quad play package. Cellcom Israel is the only local Company that offers a full quad package with an attractive all-in price, providing savings for the customer. At the same time, we increased our total income per household and customer loyalty. Our quad play activity brings us new subscribers to full end-to-end service and many of them stay with us for the long haul.
Our long-term strategy is to continue to broaden the communication service we offer, bringing new growth engines in new areas has focused on this year at internet infrastructure. Throughout this year, we have been laying down our fiber optic network to the home. We have reached 120 -- approximately 120,000 households throughout Israel as of today that are within the coverage range of our fiber optic network and are able to join our Super Fiber service. We’re preparing for the completion of the contemplated IBC transaction that we first announced a few months ago, so that within the next three years, we’ll offer internet service over optic fiber to more than 0.5 million households in Israel.
We announced today that we entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Israel Infrastructure Fund or IRF for IRF’s co-investment in IBC. This will be carried out in equal parts between Cellcom Israel and IIF. We see IIF’s entry as an equal partner to IBC subject to the completion of the transaction as an important step in addressing, both IBC and internet infrastructure in Israel.
As a background, IIF, which was established in 2007, is the first and largest infrastructure fund in Israel, specializing in the infrastructure sector. IIF currently manages $1.9 billion on behalf of its managed funds and is backed by leading Israeli financial institutes, as well as investors from Europe and North America. We believe that entering IBC in partnership with IIF and alongside, Israel Electricity Company, already in the near future, will generate a real revolution in the Internet infrastructure field in Israel and will place Cellcom Israel in a leading competitive position in the advanced landline infrastructure market.
IBC’s license has the exclusive right to deploy fiber optic through the Israeli Electric Company or IEC infrastructure, enabling the provision of speeds of up to 1 gigabytes per second, 20 times what is typically today in Israel. We expect it to enable us to make significant saving in terms of existing fixed-line infrastructure and will allow us to offer value added products and services to our customers. We’re very excited with the potential of all of this in this respect.
As we move towards 2019, we’re taking steps in order to improve the results in the Cellular segment while continuing to grow in fixed-line with our TV and triple offering. We’re also working hard to roll out fiber-to-the-home, a network which is expected to decrease wholesale cost, increase revenue and offer the best internet user experience.
And with that, I’d like to turn the call over to our CFO, Mr. Shlomi Fruhling for a review of our financials. Please, Shlomi."
Shlomi Fruhling ,0,"Thank you, Nir, and good day to all of you.
I will provide a summary of the results. The details can be found in the press release we issued earlier today.
Revenue for the third quarter of 2018 totaled NIS 910 million, 6.7% lower than the NIS 975 million reported in the third quarter of last year. The decrease in revenue was due to a 3.4% decrease in service revenues and 16.8% decrease in equipment revenue. It is important to note that the third quarter included New Year’s holiday season in Israel. So, there were relatively less working days than the third quarter of the last year, which impacted equipment sales.
The fixed-line segment service revenue grew 6.2% over the third quarter last year, partly compensating for the 9.2% decline in the cellular segment service revenue over third quarter last year. The growth in fixed-line segment service revenue was due to the growth in our subscriber base in TV and internet infrastructure services.
Third quarter EBITDA was NIS 184 million or 20.2% of revenues and 18.6% decrease compared with NIS 226 million or 33.2% of revenue in the third quarter of last year. Third quarter EBITDA from cellular segment was NIS 111 million compared with NIS 160 million in the third quarter of last year. And the EBITDA from the fixed-line segment was NIS 73 million compared with NIS 66 million in the third quarter of last year. 
Third quarter net income was NIS 1 million compared with the net income of NIS 32 million in the third quarter of last year. Third quarter free cash flow was NIS 34 million compared with NIS 105 million in third quarter of last year, mainly due to decrease in receipts from customers and operators, from higher cash capital expenditures in fixed assets, from an increase in payments to employees due to the employee voluntary retirement plans from the second quarter of 2018. This decrease was partly offset by decrease in purchase of user equipment.
Our cash capital expenditures during the third quarter of 2018 totaled NIS 160 million. As of the end of the quarter, our net debt stood at approximately NIS 2.3 billion. Our cellular subscriber base was 2.825 million at the end of the third quarter, increasing by 16,000 subscribers in the quarter. The cellular subscriber churn rate in the third quarter was 10% compared with 11.5% in the third quarter last year. ARPU in the cellular segment for the third quarter was NIS 52.5 compared with NIS 57.8 in the third quarter last year, a slight improvement from NIS 51.8 in the previous quarter. 
With that, I’d like to open the call for questions. Operator?"
Operator,1,"[Operator instructions] The first question is from Michel Klahr of Citibank. Please go ahead. Michel, Please go ahead."
Michel Klahr,1,Hi. Can you hear me okay. 
Nir Sztern,1,"Yes, Michel. "
Michel Klahr,1,"Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Firstly on mobile, you put those price increases at the beginning of November. I think what’s the -- are they sticking, how’s that working out so far? And also on mobile, the -- on the second quarter call, I think you made a comment about you had a big provision and the costs were meant to be coming down. How’s that working out? If I look at year-on-year, there’s a big decline in mobile EBITDA. So, I am just trying to kind of understand the trajectory of that line item? Thanks."
Nir Sztern,1,"I am not sure we understood the second question, but I’ll answer the first question and then maybe you can clarify the second one again. So, like I said, we increased the prices for our packages that we’re selling on the beginning of November. I can say that we’re very satisfied with the results. What we said is that we’re offering new price plan that on the one hand increases price by NIS 10; on the other hand, gives a lot of benefit to the customers, in terms of data usage that they can use for, in their favorite apps. So, around two weeks since we launched it; we’re very happy with the results."
Michel Klahr,1,"Okay. Thanks. I’ll just clarify my second question. If I look at year-on-year decline in EBITDA, it’s kind of almost NIS 50 million, and I know you said some of that because of the holiday. But, I know you’ve got a cost cutting program in place; you’ve raised prices. How should we think about the trajectory for mobile EBITDA going forward? Is it -- how long -- are those prices having enough of a price increases, having enough of an impact, and at the same time is your cost cutting having enough of an impact, those kind of mobile declines, mobile EBITDA declines can start to stabilize?"
Shlomi Fruhling,1,"Well, I mean, obviously, I’m not in a position that I can give you guidance in terms of where the prices are going to go. We’ve done what we’ve done. We’re very satisfied with how it was done and the impact that it’s had so far. But, I think it’s very early days. It’s only two weeks since we made the changes in the plans. So, it’s a little bit too early to say how it’s going to affect the following quarters. The one thing I can say is that we’re very focused on doing the best we can despite the competitive arena, to see some changing in the mobile landscape. And we’re doing everything we can to make these changes happen."
Michel Klahr,1,"And if I could just ask about the agreement you announced today. Will you be receiving any income as a result of that agreement, or is all the investment going into the IBC project? And also, if you could give us an understanding of the timeline, how long it will take to or you think it will take to get them signed off and see you can start working on that properly?"
Nir Sztern,1,"Well, I mean, [indiscernible] or IIF have joined us. It’s a question of putting money together in IBC. We’re not going to get directly, at least not any money immediately from the transaction. It means that they’re partnering with us to join IBC. The MOU that we signed with IBC state that we, pending closing obviously, will hold 70% of the Company and 30% will be held by the Israeli Electric Company. [Indiscernible] IIF are joining us, meaning that the 70% will be divided equally between the two partners 35% for us and for them, meaning the NIS100 million that we are going to pay to get into the Company, we’re going to share. Any future investment in the Company is going to be equally shared between the two companies. In terms of when we’re closing, we’re working really hard, both with -- especially with the Israel Electric Company and with IBC, and we’re making progress there. Hopefully, it won’t take us too long to finish all the agreements and for closing."
Michel Klahr,1,"And my last question is, if I understand investment is kind of one-for-one, you’re going to share investment going forward. If I look at your, on the free cash flow basis currently, you’re not -- at a stage now that you’re not producing very much cash. So, my question is, you obviously have current investments in fiber. Are you able to increase your investments in fiber above what you’re currently investing yourself? And if so, how do you plan to do that? Where’s the -- given your financial health currently, how would you be able to fund and increase investment in fiber?"
Nir Sztern,1,"Like you said, looking at the current CapEx of Cellcom, it includes quite a bit of CapEx regarding the fiber network. We stated today that we reach 120,000 households that we can offer a broadband to. So obviously, there won’t be a need to do a double investment, not both in IBC and Cellcom. That’s going to make a big difference. So…"
Michel Klahr,1,"Okay. So, I won’t see -- we won’t see an increase in your investments. It will be taking those investments that you’re currently making and doing them with your partner and with leverage, obviously through that vehicle? "
Nir Sztern,1,"Absolutely, exactly. I think it will be very minor."
Michel Klahr,1,"Okay, all right. That’s very helpful. Thanks."
Nir Sztern,1,Sure.
Operator,1,"There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Sztern, would you like to make your concluding statement."
Nir Sztern,1,"Yes. I’d like to thank all of you for joining our conference call and your continued interest in the Company. Look forward to hosting you again on our next call. Happy Thanksgiving to all our American friends and happy Black Friday to all our Israeli friends, and see you next time."
Operator,1,Thank you. This concludes the Cellcom Israel Ltd. Third quarter 2018 results conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may go ahead and disconnect.
