Darren Jameson,0,"So, good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our half year results presentation. As I have already mentioned to some of you earlier this morning, our CFO Russ Houlden can't be with us today. Russ is having an operation on his knee and needs to stay off his feet for few weeks or keep his dancing suppressed. Fortunately for us, we have a very capable substitute in our Group Controller, Phil Aspin, who many of you will already know. And this morning Phil and I will update you on our progress in AMP6, and I'll then run through the headlines from the AMP7 business plan we submitted to Ofwat at the beginning of September.
A few weeks after submitting our plan we were delighted that many of you took the time to attend our capital markets day and here how our pioneering systems thinking strategy is enabling a very new and individual approach delivering water and wastewater services setting new benchmarks for the sector. We took the opportunity to showcase customer service performance which is positioning us as a leader both in our sector and more widely. And we are pleased to see the analyst and investor reaction has been positive. We are very well positioned as we transition from AMP6 to AMP7.
Looking first at our targets for AMP6. We are delivering good operational and customer service performance mainly we are on track to deliver our guidance for overall AMP6 performance. On totex, we're confident in delivering our AMP6 scope for 100 million less than our final determination assumption. On outcome delivery incentives or ODIs we continue to expect to outturn at a positive net reward for AMP6 between zero and 30 million. And this expected net award for AMP6 will represent an outcome around the top quartile of our original P10 to P90 range representing strong performance across the full range of our ODIs and reflecting a leading underlying operational performance.
Continued improvement in customer satisfaction over AMP6 now means that we expect to be eligible for same reward of 11 million or more. And we previously announced that taking totex ODIs SIM and financing our performance into account means that we are confident to share this outperformance with customers. So we are on track to reinvest the total of 250 million before the end of AMP6 in schemes that benefit customers and the environment which position us well for AMP7.
Key to achieving our targets has been a strategy through AMPs 5 and 6 to invest in sustainable excellence and performance and the result of this approach is evident. I'll highlight just a few of the proof points on this slide. We have been a top rated 4 star leading company with the environment agency for the last three consecutive years. The Drinking Water Inspectorate considers us as the most improved company for 2017, achieving top mean zonal compliance in 2017 and one of the leading water and sewage companies under its new Compliance Risk Index. Ofwat recognized us a leading industry performer through the Beast from the East and our Systems Thinking strategy supported enhanced resilience. And we have met our leakage target for the last 12 years and we are on track to repeat this performance again this year, despite some of the most challenging weather for decades. So we approach AMP7 as an operational leader in our sector well-positioned to meet the opportunities it presents.
Turning now to customer service. We have once again improved our first and second quarter quality of service incentive mechanism or SIM scores year-on-year. We have been rated one of the top-performing water and sewerage companies despite the real challenges arising from free store earlier this year followed by the driest three month period in 81 years of record. We are very grateful for the efforts our customers made this summer to reduce their water use and their actions along with the hard work of our operational teams together with the coordination of our integrated control center, and then we are able to maintain supplies to households and businesses across the region. While our call center teams handles an intense period of customer engagement and Iâ€™m very proud of them all. 
Whilst now all company share quantitative SIM data based on our performance in the first three years of AMP6 and our further improvement in the first half of this year, we can see that we remain a leading water and sewage company on SIM and expect to be eligible for a reward. 
Innovation and use of emerging technology has been key to our improvements in customer satisfaction. Customers want to interact with us when they want using the channel of their choice. We now have around a third of our customers registered from my account portal allowing them to interact with us digitally. Over 43% of all customer contacts are now automated the highest in the sector and customers can move home, change to direct debit and check water quality using the portal. Earlier this year, we launched a fully functional app to provide customers with a mobile portal. We made a great start with 4 million in payments taken by the app in the first seven months of operation and a few weeks ago, we extended the app functionality to provide customers with the capability to report a leak helping us with GPS location, photograph and classifying the nature of the leak a trickle or a gusher. 
These and many other innovations are contributing to a reduction in our costs to serve down 24% since the start of this app with more savings yet to come. Proof that good service costs less. Our digital transformation and customer service has led to 78% of customers now paying us by direct debit, not only does this help reduce our cost to serve but also allows to focus time and effort on those customers that really need help and support. We recognize that we have some fantastic affordability schemes but that awareness was low in areas where deprivation was highest. So through our talent action approach working in local communities we've been proactive in matching customers with relevant affordability schemes and we have a 50% success rate of re-engaging with customers who never paid us before. 18 months on we measure something called stickability and 69% of those customers are still paying us. 
This approach has been recognized through several awards for ethical debt collection not just in utility sector but across service providers from all sectors. Our bad debt performance has benefited from an improvement in the customer data that we hold and full credit sharing with the credit reference agency. Our household bad debt is tracking at its lowest ever level of 2.1% of regulated revenue and improvement from 2.5% in the first half of last year and 2.8% in the first half of the year before that. This significant improvement in our bad debt performance has been fundamental to the reduction in our costs to serve.
Looking now at customer sentiment more generally and how we compare with leading brands in other sectors, since its introduction in AMP5 savings been a catalyst for improved customer satisfaction across the water sector. And Ofwat intends to introduce a new metric for AMP7, C-MeX for domestic customers and D-MeX for developers. These measures remain in development, although it's clear that customer sentiment toward their water company will play an even bigger role in company's eligibility for reward or penalty. At least for many years measured customers sentiment in our region, scoring well against other respected brands such as John Lewis, Marks & Spencer and Virgin. And we engage in surveys by the UK customer the UK institute of customer service, which measure the customer satisfaction across multiple sectors and are published as the UK CSI metric. We were delighted to learn that we were the top-placed water and sewage company in the most recent UK CSI survey and the most improved utility company overall. 
More recently, we were awarded the Institute of Service mark with distinction, positioning us amongst the small group of companies in the U.K. to receive this accolade. This all serves to build confidence in our potential to perform well under Ofwat's new customer service metrics for AMP7. 
Turning now to systems thinking and innovation, where we believe our approach is the most sophisticated in the sector and provides a real competitive advantage. During our capital markets event in September, we showcased how our pioneering Systems Thinking strategy developed in AMP5 is now delivering real and material improvements in operational performance and efficiency. We also had our plans for targeted capability enhancements, which will deliver further significant benefit. We are finding that each new development opens our eyes and minds to even greater potential. 
We mentioned Harvey at the Capital Markets event an artificial intelligence tool that significantly reduced operating cost across the pilot water network, And we've now signed a framework agreement with a Canadian company, EMAGIN, to deploy this tool across our region, and we estimate total potential savings to be around 10 million per annum. 
Technology is also being deployed to deliver savings across our capital program. We're using virtual and augmented reality to improve the creation and subsequent operation of assets. Laser scanning is being used to create digital models of existing sites, within which we can overlay virtual representations of new assets preconstruction. With this then 3D printing we are seeing reductions of up to 90% in the downtime for projects on site, along with cost savings of around 30% compared with traditional methods. I previously mentioned our innovation hub and some of the great technology and processes that are emerging from this unique capability and with innovation as one of our core values, we are always looking for ways to deepen this culture across the business and we recently introduced an employee innovation app that engages our workforce in offering up ideas and in the co-creation of solutions to different challenges in the business and the response to this has been tremendous. 
System Thinking was fundamental, to the resilience we demonstrated in maintaining customer service during the beast from east at the start of the year, and again in the summer with the driest three month period in the Northwest in 81 years of record. Both events led to increased leakage mainly through ground movement due to rapid pre fall or ground desiccation and our fantastic field team, supported by our Integrated Control Centre, meant that we spotted issues before they become problems and we were able to minimize customer impact, and I'm very proud as the way in which our team performed during both events. Our response to free score was recognized as amongst the best performing companies, by Ofwat and during the dry summer, working with customers to reduce record lows of the water consumption along with our operational interventions helps us to avoid the need to implement a temporary use of hosepipe restriction. We've been operating over the summer with more than double the usual number of leakage crews but we remain on track to meet our leakage target by yearend adding to last 12 consecutive years in which we have met or beaten our target. We have already announced that the dry weather will cause us to expand around 80 million totex more than planned this year principally on increased resources, power and in bringing new groundwater sources into supply.
I'll now hand you over to Phil to take you through our financial performance."
Phil Aspin,0,"Thanks Dave and good morning everyone. So let's start first with our reported income statement. We have delivered another good set of results for the six months to the 30th September 2018. Reported profit after tax of 212 million was up 15 million as a result of higher allowed regulatory revenue and lower finance expense only partly offset by one off dry weather costs.
Let's next look at the underlying income statement which we believe is more representative of underlying business performance. You will find a reconciliation of the adjusted items that arriving at these underlying measures in the appendix of this presentation. Revenue of 916 million increased by 40 million largely reflecting our allowed regulatory revenue profile. Underlying operating profit of 368 million was up 24 million. This reflects the increase in revenue partly offset by an increase in infrastructure renewals expenditure and an increase in depreciation which I will cover on the next slide. Underlying profit before tax of 240 million increased by 46 million. This affects the increase in underlying operating profit and the decrease in the underlying net finance expense due to lower RPI inflation applied to our index-linked debt. So a strong financial performance for the underlying profit after tax of 197 million giving an increase in underlying EPS of 23%.
Lastly, we were aware that some of our peers exclude the impact of differed tax in deriving their underlying profit after tax and EPS figures. We are considering the merits to aligning to this approach and expect to provide an update of the full year results in May. However we excluded the impact of deferred tax for the six months ended 30th of September underlying profit after tax will be 215 million and our underlying EPS will be 31.5 pence per share.
So let's now focus on underlying operating cost. In overview we have again managed to maintain tight credit control of our underlying costs basis despite a backdrop of rising inflation. Total underlying operating expenses increased by 17 million this affects an Â£11 million increase in infrastructure renewals expenditure, primarily due to the phasing of the large customer project with a significant element of IRE spend and an expected Â£6 million increase in depreciation from the increasing asset base. The remaining cost basis will be flat as small increases in areas such as materials were offset by a Â£10 million credit resulting from the settlement of a historic commercial claim, compensating us the cost that we've incurred in previous years. While the amount is not significant I do think it is also worth highlighting the reduction in household bad debts. As Steve has already explained this is now tracking at its lowest ever level of 2.1% of regulatory revenue and we see this improved level being sustainable into the future.
Lastly you will recall ahead of financial close we updated the market that the dry weather event from this summer was expected to result in the spending an additional Â£80 million of totex. This remains our best estimate and the analysis of expenditures is included in the appendix of this presentation. At the half year, the adjusted item of 25 million comprises 6.8 million of IRE spend and 18.2 million of operating cost. 
Now letâ€™s turn the statement of financial position. Property, funds and equipment was up 154 million and net debt was up 46 million, reflecting expenditure on our ongoing capital program. We continue to have an IAS 19 retirement benefit surplus, which I'll talk about on the next slide. 
Cash and short-term deposits reduced by 250 million and gross borrowings similarly reduced by 205 million, mainly reflecting the timing of finance raised toward the end of last year and maturities of debt in the current year. Both derivative assets and liability positions reduced by around 30 million reflecting maturity swaps and movements in market rates. Retained earnings of around 2.1 billion were relatively flat.
So now letâ€™s turn our attention to pensions. During 2018 Ofwat's consultation put in the sector both in balance highlighted importance of this area in the broader assessments of capital structure resilience and long-term viability. As illustrative our pensions position has been well-controlled for many years for our asset liability matching approach mitigating risk for the pension scheme and ultimately shareholders. This continue to be the case at September 2018 and we have an IFRS surplus of 326 million. 
With Brexit approaching and the potential for increased uncertainty in the financial market volatility is reassuring to note with our pension schemes investment in low risk corporate bonds and guilds with full hedging of interest on inflation risk limiting any potential impact. Lastly as you will recall from our full year results in May, we updated you that we have implemented a revised inflation hedging policy. This policy considers many factors, including the pension scheme maintenance external inflation hedging to replace the inflation funding mechanism. Given the relative attractiveness of market rates earlier in the summer the pensions scheme has not fully hedged its inflation exposure in the external market in place of the IFR. 
Turning next to a robust capital structure, this chart shows the stability in RCV gearing since 2011. For many years we have maintain the consistent policy of targeting RCV gearing 55% to 65%. And this is been supportive of United Utilities Water maintaining a Moodyâ€™s A3 credit rating. This has provided a robust capital base and underpins the financial resilience in the business for the long-term. In Moodyâ€™s most recent assessment of the sector we generally saw a deterioration in the outlook of ratings across the sector United Utilities Water retained its A3 credit rating with a stable outlook.
Taking together with our pension position this gives us an extremely robust capital base, providing a high degree of resilience and financial flexibility as we look to the future. To completeness we will now consider the final principle statements of cash flow. The key takeaways here is that the changing cash used in financing activities reflects the timing of finance raised. Importantly, as you're aware, the nature of regulatory model means cash flow is only part of the picture with the inflation return on the RCV comprising a non-cash uplift which is neither reported as income nor as cash flow, and this is why RCV gearing and its trend over time remains the best indicator of a sustainable business model. 
Now, a recap of our financing position. Over the 2015 to 2020 regulatory period, we have financing requirements totaling around 2.5 billion of which we've now raised 2.3 billion, we were the first in the sector to achieve CPI linked debt and remains one of the sector leaders in the issuance of CPI-linked debt, having previously raised 165 million in response to Ofwat's decision to transition away from RPI. 
In September we increased the amount of cash outstanding about Â£ 300 million probably bond issued in February 2018 by an additional Â£50 million taking this big brand to 350 million total. Since March 2018, we've also renewed or extended around 150 million of committed bank facilities out of a total 750 million under our revolving balance sheet program. In line with our board approved this management policy, we have a comfortable liquidity position and this extends out to 2020. 
And finally, an update on the cost of debt and hedging, as a reminder our inflation hedging policy is to target around 50% of net-debt to be maintained in index linked form. With regard to interest rate hedging, our policy has the fixed interest rates on a nominal debt on the 10 year, reducing balance basis thereby broadly replicating a 10 year trailing average. In AMP7 we will no longer implement our topward hedge once the cost of debt left finalized, we are recognizing our intention to apply indexation the new debt during the course of AMP7. The average cost of our Â£3.8 billion long-term index linked debt portfolio is 1.3% real. For the most recent issuances of lower rates reflecting the current low interest rate environment. In respect of nominal debt, this is virtually all fixed through the 2015 to 2020 at an arbitrate ratio around 3.2% nominal. This low cost of debt were resulting prices are in a strong position to deliver significant financing in our performance through 2020. 
So to summarize this is another good set of results in which we have maintained very tight cost control, a strong balance sheet, robust capital structure, while gearing and our financial risk management and pension position offset to leading and underpin financial resilience over the long-term. Low cost of debt that we have locked in puts us in a strong position to deliver significant financing outperformance of 2020, and our current position alongside our revised inflation, interest rate heading policies provides financial flexibility as we look to the future. We are well-prepared for AMP7. 
So thank you, and I'll hand back to Steve. "
Steve Mogford,0,"Thanks Phil. So as we delivered our PR19 business plans to Ofwat in the beginning of September covering the period 2020 to 2025 or AMP7. Our plan is ambitious, high quality, transparent, and rich in content and we gave a briefing as the key features of our plans to the market on the 4th of September and here are the key headlines. Our AMP7 business plan delivers against all key areas with the compelling proposition of improved service at lower prices. We are proposing a 10.5% real time average price reduction over the 5 years period meaning that by 2025 customers will be benefited from 15 years of bill reductions in real terms. This reduction along with other targeted support will help over 300,000 households out of water poverty. We start stretching service targets which address customer priorities established thorough extensive customer engagement. And our package of outcome delivery incentives is comprehensive and straightforward. On resilience, our 250 million outperformance reinvestment in AMP6 gives us the reducing risk picture with measures in our plan to improve resilience further in AMP7. And our proposal to replace the Haweswater Aqueduct serving Manchester and Pennines customers will address our greatest operational risk. 
And finally, I've already talked about how our Systems Thinking is a fundamental shift in our approach and delivering enhanced operational efficiency and we have plans to develop this even further in AMP7. Our plan delivers a 1 billion saving in wholesale cost for AMP7 compared to AMP5 and this is comprised around 450 million of savings resulting from innovation on AMP5 and 6. Further 360 million through applications and industry leading market testing framework and 230 million from root and branch challenge of investment needs and costs. And on retail we plan to reduce our annual cost to serve by 48 million around a third over the period 2015 to 2025 and this comes from significant reduction in bad debt, and operational efficiency arising from improved service and digital transformation. This slide compares the opportunity in our ODI proposals for AMP7 against our ODIs for AMP6. We expect to do well against our AMP6 ODIs in earning a net reward with the likely outcome around the top quartile of our original P10 to P90 range. And our proposals for AMP7 are symmetrical with an estimated reward potential of over 400 million. So there is much more to play for in terms of reward for superior performance and this is where our track record across the last two AMPs gives us a good start.
On household retail it's a similar position in AMP6 and as I mentioned earlier through great performance, we expect to be eligible for reward of 11 million or more for AMP6 performance. For AMP7 the proposed position is again more balanced and under the new customers satisfaction measures C-MeX and D-MeX the range is symmetrical at plus or minus 0.3% return on regulated equity, or approximately 70 million.
So in summary we are a true leader in the sector. We perform well through the exceptional weather we have experienced this year. Our strategy to deliver sustainable leading operational performance through Systems Thinking is paying off with more to come. We are outperforming in AMP6 expecting totex and financing savings plus ODIs and rewards. And as a consequence we reinvest 250 million of our outperformance this AMP in enhanced resilience measures. We have submitted an ambitious high-quality PR19 plan, reflecting extensive customer engagement in assessing our priorities for AMP7. I'm very proud of my team, proud of our achievements and excited about our future.
Thanks for listening, and now I would like to invite any questions."
Q - Chris Laybutt,1,"Chris Laybutt calling from JPMorgan. Starting with a bang. Two questions for me please. The first is Phil you mentioned some changes to reporting could you give us just the considerations that stemming into that decision and the discussions you had so far I guess a bit of flavor for that. And could that be a last year in AMP6 change? Or is more likely to be a change going into AMP7 in terms of your EPS reporting? 
Second question just on ODIs that the Slide 28. Could you discuss the cryptosporidium issues that you had in AMP6? Do you consider those issues to be one off? Can you reassure investors that issue won't happen again? And what was the financial impact on AMP6 ODIs which might instruct us on how you might perform in AMP7?"
Steve Mogford,1,John will do the first one and then I'll do the crypto.
Unidentified Company Representative,1,"So I guess on the EPS reporting we are aware that different people take a slightly different approach and some people effectively strip out different attacks which is right to do in the context of a regulatory model and have a regulatory model the economics works. I guess there are broader considerations to be had during that. So weâ€™re going to take time over the next few months and in May weâ€™ll be looking at how we intent to report partnership going forward, recognizing the sort of benefits consistency across the sector."
Steve Mogford,1,"On crypto to the interesting feature on crypto was that we had a those remain and some of the details we published essentially what happened, we had a penetration of service reservoir so that was seam in the service reservoir where we have penetration through the seam and groundwater outside of the service reservoir must have been infected with cryptosporidium, we never been able to repeat that, we never been able to identify absolutely where the source of that crypto came from. We have theories but we've never been able to repeat it. What has led to is a number of things. The first is a complete different test regime which essentially now is probably the leading benchmark test regime for the service reservoir which essentially extensively floods the whole area around the service reservoir via the penetration. 
The other is a different inspection regime because of the techniques that one would have used historically might have been robots and robotic cameras sounding in service reservoir which were full of water looking for the leakage and others. And what we found is that the test techniques, which have been traditionally used wouldnâ€™t have found that particular point of penetration. So essentially as part throughout six, we been going through all of our service reservoir conducting rigorous testing and looking for potential leaks or points of penetration and undertaking repairs.
So essentially when you look at it in a situation like this I think probably now, and not long enough than to never say never on anything. But I think when you look at it would probably now better protected anybody in terms of what we done to do. The other feature which is interesting around and so itâ€™s interesting to people like me and side enough for finding things interestingly. Is that first penetration of cryptosporidium we found literally within days and we stopped it and what was really interesting during that period was that we had several days where we can see the cryptosporidium being cleared, flushed through the system as people use water obviously off the boil in what weâ€™re doing. 
It was about a week later, Steve and I both came in one Saturday morning and we saw the first detection again of cryptosporidium in the water and we had no idea where it was coming from. And by that a month later that's site looked like some we dug up everything to find out where we can. What we found a year later after around through testing this was some research that the national laboratory has conducted, was that what we saw in the second event wasnâ€™t cryptosporidium it was an algae mimic of cryptosporidium completely harmless and so effectively we advanced you could argue that through our labors we advanced science over that period. But it did mean we probably had customers on boiled water notice for at least three weeks longer than they really needed to because that had a harmless algae in the water. By the time we finished the algae had been zapped with UV. So I think a number of measures effectively but it is enormous what does it cost us and it cost us 25 million as an event we effectively said that. And the majority of that was actually compensation. Since then, though, our investment in our water area within our FD and within some of the resilience measures we've taken effectively has given us further resilience across the network by accelerating things that we might otherwise have done at a slower pace but 25 million was the headline number. "
Iain Turner,1,"Turning back to Slide 26, your efficiency slide and the retail side of things it looks like what you are seeing there is that if you take out the bad debt and just look at your cost ex bad debt you are basically standing still over the 10 year period. I wonder whether that's likely to be good enough in terms of Ofwat thinking? "
Steve Mogford,1,"And I think when you actually I mean our costs to serve in terms of our resources that have been coming down and let me talk about that in a second, so we've got little bit of more here effectively as customer services I think as you as we go forward as we saw to look at improved bad debt performance as we start getting people onto greater and greater digital penetration in use of other channel we will reduce that further. So the reason for further scope and within our plans we go into AMP7 there is further scope to reduce cost outside of bad debt."
Unidentified Company Representative,1,"So the intent of delivering the efficiency and bad debt you actually have to invest quite significantly both in terms of accessing additional data and in relation to increasing stable quality and collections activity but also in terms of the efforts of that today making sure that those customers pay you and have to actually we are accessing them to device for liberty's game section of things what they've talked about in terms of and those sorts of things so I'd say what we have seen is our bad debt performance comes down significantly but actually from a cost of collections we are actually in bad debt to make sure we take the returns in a bad debt better. 
So you've actually pointed out the a digital we're leading in effective in terms of actually those customers who're actually choosing to interact with us on a digital basis, and that continues as we go through the AMP period. But what I'm very clear about in terms of the plan that I've put forward into the next price review is actually we have also invested further exceptional customer service so this is an effort at slash and burn actually, we've had fantastic customer service performance, and we want to maintain that I'm not announcing the names that we will invest and actually spend very nice delivery improvement into their customers. "
Unidentified Company Representative ,1,"Okay, we do capitalize once we get those people on plans once we get people on that cost reserve what compound. "
James Brand ,1,"James Brand from Deutsche Bank. Three questions please. The first is on the comments on potential change to exclude deferred tax from your earnings and your net profit definition. In that statement you gave some details in saying that the normal effective cash tax rate is around 11% but they've been pretty low this year and then next year we would increase around 20, so I just want to clarify because I'm thinking about the next regulatory period and your level of cash tax should I be thinking the 11% or a different number? Thatâ€™s the first question. Second question is on, when we can expect to find out about your dividend policy for the next regulatory period? In the last -- at the last review, the companies are pretty quick after final determinations to announce their new dividend policies, should that be a base case? And if you do get fast-tracked at the end of January, could we maybe even hope that we might get an update on the dividend policy in February next year? And then the third question, we're starting to get a bit more details on what the government wants to -- or at least what the Prime Minister wants to implement around Brexit? And obviously, some debate around whether that's actually going to happen or not. But now we have the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration and some details in there around nonaggression clauses on environmental matters. So wondering whether you could give us maybe a view on what you think that might mean for you in terms of some of the EU legislation or U.K. legislation that might end up in your investments?"
Steve Mogford,1,Okay. Do you want to do deferred tax?
Phil Aspin,1,"Yes, let me start with it, deferred tax. I think it's actually a question on cash tax really. It wasn't in terms of percentages. So I mean it's very well level of cash tax in this half year sort of the headline of the corporation tax is 19%, sort of back out from there, sort of capital allowances and pension contributions, which would take you down to sort of about 10%, 9% level overall effectively of a cash tax run rate. The impact has been further reduced in this half year is a combination of the fact with that rate and the way the quarterly payments for tax works is we struggle from one year to the next. And so what you have gotten this half year is the sort of last two installments of last year's cash tax number. And the way that doesn't go through the system is people tend to prudently pay more tax in the first two installments and less in the second two as you get better visibility in that number. So that together, we have effectively higher profits in this reported period compared to last reported period gives you effectively the reduction down to 3%. So in summary and in terms of next down position, you would expect the capital allowance position to remain broadly the same, the pension's position taken down to sort of around about 10% level cash tax. And thatâ€™s what we will go through into customer base."
Steve Mogford,1,"Okay. And on dividend, I think the base case that you quoted, which is being in a position to announce after a final determination. So we expect -- whether you are fast-tracked or on the northeast step, you could expect that final determinations for every company will broadly at the same time at the end of the period because there are one or two things that this time around Ofwat have said they are not going to lock down at fast-track stage. So for example, the WACC, they won't lock that down at fast-tracked, they will still consider that for all companies in final determinations. So I think, I probably would be a reasonable to expect that the base case certainly for us would be post final determination in December. You then have about a month to consider taking it towards the end of January. And I think thereafter, companies will be in a better position understand what their dividend picture would be, or certainly, we would in the context of a final determination. So I think, base assumption, I think itâ€™s a little bit ambitious to think that a final determination would be there. Nice aspiration. I think as far as Brexit is concerned, I mean, I think our position on Brexit is just look for certainty like everybody else, really, and a clear understanding of what's happening rather than crashing out with a high degree of uncertainty? I think when you look at what we've been doing along with our sector colleagues we've been looking at what the implications of Brexit might be. Principally, we are looking at materials, particularly chemicals coming in from overseas. So the sector is working together really to look at what is our demand for materials that we sourced either through or outside of Europe. And then more importantly, having identified that as a sector how do we make sure that we can achieve a continuous supply, particularly for those that are allowed. So I think a lot of work going on there and tremendous collaboration with [indiscernible] with government in terms of understanding these issues. So I think preparations are well enhanced in hand in that regard."
Fraser McLaren,1,Good morning. It's Fraser McLaren from Merrill Lynch. Good morning. Could you speak a little bit about the additional GBP 80 million spend this year please? How much of that is just to maintain service that's taking place? And how much will have enduring benefit for the business? And also could you clarify the relationship between this and the GBP 250 million reinvestment commitment?
Steve Mogford,1,"Okay. I mean, essentially, you can take GBP 80 million and broadly half of it between what you considered to be dealing with the issue at the time and what effectively our capital expenditure to deliver enhanced resilience, which was a function of dealing with the issue, but also looking at how one might enhance resilience going forward. So I mentioned that this was a sort of worst drive period on record. And what we saw was, firstly, very high levels of leakage combined with very high levels of customer demand. So customer demand went up by something like 25%. So we could meet that with production -- by ramping up production, but a lot of the expenditure in the first part of the dry weather incident, that was during dry weather was simply just getting water to people even through our network or through tinkering, and being able to manage resources around the region. So the big issue we had was very, very dry weather in Cumbria, which is major source of water. And so we were basically taking the pressure off of the Cumbria and leaning on our Southern resources. And so lots of pumping, so lots of energy, lots of overtime associated with what we're doing, tankering water, and also doubling our leak detection and fix increase. So we normally have around just under 80 crews operating in field any point in time, sorry, just under 50 actually, and we were 120 crews a peak. So that was really all about dealing with the issue itself. What we also needed to do, because we are very dependent on surface water in the Northwest uniquely so compared to other parts of the country. We were looking for additional water sources, particularly groundwater. And over the period, what weâ€™ve done is we've doubled access to groundwater sources. So I think by the time we finish, we will be about 12% of groundwater capability, which allows us to lean on that rather than reservoirs during that period. And a lot of the expenditure is about -- was about bringing boreholes into supply, but the decision we took was to harden those. So as firstly to ensure that those were available to us going forward, but also its hardened their connections into our network, so that they were -- the water was effectively transported straight into the network and to treatment. And that essentially increased the resilience that we had, we think about 100 and 200 in terms of where we are coming out to this particular issue, but it's about 50-50."
Philip Aspin,1,The second question was actually would be GBP 250 million.
Steve Mogford,1,"In terms of the -- thanks, Phil, It's better having a younger man with us, I think, memory, with the memory. I think the second half of that, the question of the GBP 250 million -- the GBP 250 million was essentially a series of resilience investments that we've planned around enhancing and things like connectivity enhancing resilience a number of our water treatment works and some environmental things. And that's completely separate from the GBP 80 million. So the GBP 80 million is additional totex. So when you look at the numbers, effectively, that GBP 80 million will go to totex and about half of it would be RCV. Okay, any other questions?"
Chris Laybutt,1,"Chris Laybutt from JP Morgan. You made some comments about your dividend at the Capital Markets Day. The question simply to put was, will you cut your dividend in AMP7? I'm just wondering if you could repeat those comments and add anything that you can add if anything incrementally has changed? That's it. Thanks."
Steve Mogford,1,"I mean essentially as far as dividend is concerned, I mean, you all know we won't make a comment or commitment about dividends until we've actually got the final determination and we know where we stand. I think the comments I made on Capital Markets Day were very much about our approach to dividend sustainability. I think the conversations discussions we've had, it was very much the first -- almost the first guidance like I've got from investors in taking the job was we're people that invest in sustainability of dividend is really important to us, pension funds, charities et cetera. And so we are very much work to a policy as dividend sustainability through AMP5, AMP6, and we've delivered that. I think when we set the dividend policy for AMP6, we said, if you remember, that we would be at least RPI. And we took a very conscious decision not to go beyond RPI, when we look forward AMP7, and some of the pictures that were emerging about we were aware of where WACC might go and how tough AMP7 might be for the companies. And we took the decision not to raise the dividend because we felt that building dividend cover towards the end of the period is more important to give us the maximum resilience we had to what you might see as pricing shifts if you go through one cycle to the next, and so building resilience effectively through cover has been our strategy. We haven't change. Our ambition is dividend sustainability. And effectively as we go forward that's how is one of our core targets. We donâ€™t know whether we can deliver that target until we've been through FD, but we haven't changed. Since the Capital Markets Day, we haven't had any information that would change the picture that I said then. I was talking -- chatting to James and Iain earlier on before we came in and essentially if you look at what happened since we submitted our plan, we've had some -- I would call it, light Q&A from Ofwat. Most of it has been where can we find the following information in the thousands of pages thatâ€™s been submitted. It's very difficult, because plans aren't in a consistent format. But other than that, there's been very little thatâ€™s come out. I think the first time we will get a view of where our plan sits in Ofwat size is end of January, when we get the risk-based review that comes out, and then you would expect a period of dialogue running up to the March-April time when you know when your fast track enhanced or worse in terms of sensitivity."
Iain Turner,1,"It's Iain Turner from Exane. Kind of talking back to the GBP 80 million of extra totex spend. Obviously, some of that is IRE and kind of OpEx, but I think quite a lot of it in the second half is going to be CapEx, and some -- quite a bit in the first half was CapEx. That money that you spent has obviously boosted your resilience into the longer term. And I just wonder what is that that stopped you doing that before? Is it something you would have liked done but regulation settlement didnâ€™t allow? I know you have done it because clearly there was need for it. And is there other area of expenditure and that sorts of thing that you might have done given a more generous regulation settlement?"
Steve Mogford,1,"I think when you look at the scenarios, we effectively produced a water resources management plan as part of the cycle -- the sector goes through. And that water resources management plan looks at what are your water resources over next 25 years, what are the things that one would need to do? And that plan, essentially modeled through the scenarios. Your base scenario is what you do, the work that you undertake, and what the plan will also say is what measures you can take in the event that you do hit the scenario of dry weather. And there are number of measures there. One is to bring boreholes into supply. The other is actually to work with the environment agency on things like drought permits and changing their interaction with the environment. All those things fit in the plan. I think what we saw was an extreme in the context of modeling and very -- localized extreme, particularly in Cumbria, and a major source. And I donâ€™t think you would have -- you -- our plan and the probabilities that we had associated with that would not have caused you to have made those particular investments. Clearly, the response to dry weather is a new plan, and some of that is basic operational activity, although very exceptional, if you look at circumstances. But I think some of those investments that we have made, I would say, are in looking at a very exceptional situation well on the margins that you are modeling that you then just going to respond to time. What we have done, actually now gives us additional resilience. But I think all of our [indiscernible] and the work that we have done would not told us to have done those things in -- within the normal probabilities. I think these are the things that we will be facing into as we see climate change and raising over levels of resilience, I think are a feature of everybody's plan actually as we go forward, both in the water and the wastewater environment."
Steve Mogford,1,"All right. Thanks very much, everybody. And thanks for your patience. And thanks to Phil. I think Russ should be seriously worried now about his performance. So thanks very much. Cheers."
