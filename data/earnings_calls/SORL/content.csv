Jin Rui Yu,0,"Thank you everyone for joining us today for the third quarter of 2018. China's GDP grew to 6.4% from 6.7% in the third quarter of third quarter and the 6.8% in the first quarter of 2018. This number is the best that we will see growth see first quarter of [2009].
According to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, China's vehicle sales fell 11.6% year-over-year in the month of September 2018. The fixed decline in nearly seven years that next job flow a year-over-year sales decline of 6.8% in August and the job of 4.7% in July. The revenue cost sales fell 12% of year-over-year to $2.1 million in September, resulting in the third quarter sales decline of 7.6% of year-over-year. Commercial vehicle sales declined promisingly 2.2% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2018.
For the nine months ending September 30, 2018, vehicle sales in China rose 1.5% passenger vehicle sales totaling 13.6 million units or 7.6% over two year-over-year gain. Commercial vehicle sales were 3.2 million, up 6.3% year-over-year. Credit for the auto loans have become more difficult and consumer confidence has been impacted by the solid stock price on China exchanges. In addition, in the 2018 year, the vehicle tax revenue rose 10.5% to its common standards of 10%, slower economic growth combined with risks specific exchange rate affected passenger vehicle sales in the third quarter and nine months of 2018 China's top economy.
Turning [indiscernible] has suggested that the declines against incentives to increase the purchasing of vehicles with engines of 1.6 litres or less. A decision has not been reached on the proposal of implementation cost automotive industry is one of the most important in China employing many people. We are pleased to reports that we have been achieved record high third quarter sales in 2018 year, following the low to high sales for any quarter in 2018 year.
Net sales for the first quarter of 2018 were 10.2% year-over-year to $108.6 million, the highest sales for any third quarter in the Company history. Domestic OEM revenues came in at high level of $50.3 million whereas China's domestic aftermarket sales up for 15.7% year-over-year due to the expiration of OEM warranties from peer view vehicle sales. And international sales rose 13.1% year-over-year due to China's growing global customer base. During the third quarter, our key competitors is failed to generate meaningful growth or suffered year-over-year decline in to their top line results.
As the largest aftermarket brake components provider in China, we believe that our increased sales and marketing campaigns enable us to the significant market share in the aftermarket segments, while many of small competitors are accounting a credit crunch, and facing possibly discontinuing operations. To protect our intellectual properties, we have been selected by China's customs to enter into the Longteng Intellectual Property Protection Program started in 2017. The Longteng Program is the Chinese government's initiative to protect the intellectual properties of the leading Chinese companies against domestic Chinese copycats.
We currently protect over 600 issued patents and we have over 700 patent applications worldwide. We expect our Chinese marketing sales will continue to grow as we expand our network throughout China and our international sales will expand as our global customer base increases. We have continued to increase our R&D investments to improve our traditional products, launch new advanced product to enhance our market share and penetrate the new passenger vehicle markets.
With that now, let me turn the call to Kevin. Thank you."
Kevin Theiss,0,"Thank you, Ms. Yu. Now, we will briefly review results for the third quarter of 2018. Net sales for the third quarter of 2018 were $108.6 million the highest sales for any third quarter in the Company's history, compared with $101.3 million in the third quarter of 2017. Revenues in the Company's domestic OEM customers of $50.3 million were approximately even with net sales in the third quarter of 2017.
Sales from China's domestic aftermarket increased 15.7% year-over-year to $36.4 million from $31.5 million in the third-quarter of 2017. The expiration of OEM warranties from prior years new vehicle sales in China drove the Company's aftermarket business. Revenues from international markets were 13.1% to 21.8 million from $19.3 million in the third quarter of 2017, mainly due to the Company's growing global customer base.
SORL's commercial vehicle brake sales increased 4.4% year-over-year to $89 million and represented 82% of total sales in the third quarter of 2018. The sales of passenger vehicle brake systems increased by 22.5% year-over-year to $19.6 million, which accounted for 18% of the total sales for the third quarter of 2018.
Gross profit for the third quarter of 2018 was $26.3 million compared to $27.3 million for the third quarter of 2017. Gross margin for the third quarter of 2018 was 24.3% compared with the gross margin of 26.9% in the same quarter last year. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to higher raw material cost and price promotions designed to increase market share during the third quarter of 2018.
Operating expenses increased by 41.9% to $22.7 million in the third quarter of 2018 from $16 million in the third-quarter of 2017. As a percentage of revenue operating expenses were 20.9% in the third quarter of 2018, compared with 15.8% third quarter of 2017. The increase in operating expenses was due to higher selling and distribution, general and administrative and research and development expenses.
Selling and distribution expenses rose to $13.2 million from $8.3 million in the same quarter of 2017. As a percentage of revenue, selling and distribution expenses were 12.1% compared with 8.2% of quarterly revenues in the same quarter last year. The increase in selling and distribution expenses was primarily the result of higher freight and packaging expenses as unit volume rose during the third quarter of 2018.
General and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2018 were $5.1 million or 4.7% of revenue compared with $4.8 million or 4.7% in the third quarter of 2017. Research and development expenses were $4.5 million in the third quarter of 2018 compared with $2.9 million in the third quarter of 2017.
As a percentage of revenue, R&D was 4.1% in third quarter of 2018 compared with 2.9% of revenue in the third quarter of 2017. The Company continues to develop new higher margin electronically controlled products and upgrade the performance and quality of the Company's traditional break products to capture a greater market share.
Interest expenses were $3.3 million in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $0.8 million in the third quarter 2017. Increase interest expenses are mainly due to a higher average interest rate and a higher average amount of loans outstanding during the third quarter of 2018.
Income before provision for income taxes was $7.1 million for the third quarter of 2018, as compared with $11.2 million for the third quarter of 2017. The decrease in income tax -- the decrease in income before taxes was primarily due to lower gross profit and higher operating expenses. Pre-tax income margin was 6.5% in the third quarter 2018 compared with 11.1% in the third quarter of 2017.
The provision for income taxes was $12.1 million in third quarter '18 compared with $1.6 million in third quarter 2017. Significantly higher taxes in the third quarter of 2018 compared with the third quarter 2017 were mainly due to one-time accrued taxes of $11 million associated with U.S. tax reform related to the plan dividend distributions from China PRC subsidiaries in order to fulfill the payment of one-time accrued taxes.
Net loss attributable stockholders during the third quarter 2018 was $5.6 million or $0.29 per basic and diluted share. Compare with net income convertible to stockholders of $8.6 million or $0.44 per basic and diluted share in the third quarter of 2017.
Excluding the impact of the one-time accrued taxes related to U.S. tax reform, net income attributable stockholders for the third quarter of 2018 would have been $5.4 million or $0.28 per basic and diluted share, compared with net income attributable to stockholders of $8.6 million or $0.44 per basic and diluted share, in the third quarter of 2017.
Now, we'll go over the first nine months of 2018 financial performance highlights. Net sales for the first nine months of 2018 increased 28.8% year-over-year to $344.8 million from $267.6 million for the first nine months of 2017. Revenues from the Company's China OEM customers increased by 16.2% to $164.7 million from $141.8 million in the same period in 2017.
Revenues from China's domestic aftermarket increase 62.3% to $117.3 million from $72.3 million in the first nine months of 2017. Revenues from the international markets increased 17.2% to $67.7 million from $53.5 million in the first nine months of 2017.
SORL's commercial vehicle break sales increased 23.5% year-over-year to $276.6 million represented 80.2% of total sales in the first nine months of 2018. The sales of passenger vehicle break systems increased by 56.3% year-over-year to $68.2 million that's accounted for 19.8% of total sales for the first nine months of 2018.
Gross profit for the first nine months of 2018 increased 24.8% to $91 million from $72.9 million in the same period in 2017. Gross margin for the first nine months of 2018 decreased to 26.4% from 27.2% for the first nine months of 2017. The Company's gross margin declined due to higher material cost and increased sales promotion to increase its market share in both OEM and after markets segments.
Operating income for the first nine months of 2018 was $30.4 million within the operating margin of 8.8%. Net income attributable to stockholders for the first nine months of 2018 was $9.4 million or $0.49 per basic and diluted share, compared with $21.4 million or $1.11 per basic and diluted share in the same period in 2017.
Excluding the impact of U.S. tax reform, net income attributable to stockholders for the first nine months of 2018 would have been $20.4 million or $1.06 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income attributable to stockholders of $21.4 million or $1.11 per basic and diluted share in the same period in 2017.
Now, I will highlight a few basic -- few balance sheet and financial items. As of September 30, 2018, the Company's cash and cash equivalents increased to $17.6 million from $4.2 million to December 31, 2017. Total stockholders; equity was $172.4 million at September 30, 2018, the Company had working capital of $85 million at September 30, 2018 with the current ratio of 1.2:1.
Cash-flow provided by operating activities for the first nine months of 2018 was $81.2 million. The business outlook, management has reiterated its fiscal year 2018 guidance for net sales or approximately $450 million, and revised net income attributable to the common stockholders to approximately $16 million. Excluding the impact of the U.S. tax reform, the net income attributable to common stockholders would have been expected to reach approximately 27 million. These targets are based on the Company's current views on the operating and market conditions which are subject to change.
With that, we now open floor up to questions. Operator?"
Operator,1,"Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer Session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of [Richard Ericson], a private investor. Please proceed with your question."
Unidentified Analyst,1,"I am very concerned and interested in finding more basic understanding of the U.S. tax reform accrual of 12.1 million and you referred that to dividend distributions. I'd like to dig further into how that, what that represents?"
Kevin Theiss,1,"[Foreign Language]
Okay, this tax reform has started in December 2017. It’s a U.S. tax reform, corporate tax reform and mainly targeting U.S. companies had subsidiaries in China. So to resolve in peace, they are acquiring those companies have always these subsidiaries to accrue the taxes associated with dividend. So since we are a registered U.S. company and also our operations in China and our operating subsidiary is in China, we now fall into that category.
Since our listing which goes back to the last eight years, so we calculated the accrued taxes for these eight year period would be $11.0 million. Again, this is a one-time transition tax and this amount is our estimate at last for the U.S. corporate income tax based on the deemed repatriation to the United States of the Company's share previously deferred earning of certain non-U.S. subsidiary of the Company.
So, all these -- now, we will talk about the impact to ongoing and plus again, at this moment what we elected to pay one-time transition tax or we accrue the one-time transition tax over the eight years commencing or starting in April 2018."
Unidentified Analyst,1,2018.
Kevin Theiss,1,"[Foreign Language]
2018. The actual impact of the U.S. reform of the Company -- tax reform on the Company may differ from our estimates. We will make update and based on the future regulation or guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury. And specific actions and also we will update you with any specific action we'll take in response to the future regulation.
Now as of September 30, 2018, there was a $1.76 million that was included in the tax payable which is put under the current liability. And we believe and this will be paid within one year. The remaining balance will be included as a long-term tax payable also our balance sheet. And so, this month and we are reporting $11, it is not immediately taking out of our cash and it's going to spread out among many quarter and many years period.
So as of the reporting day today, there has no condition tax payment has been made."
Unidentified Analyst,1,"Correct. But this $11 million, does this represent past do situations you talked about last eight years? Or does it -- does it include future payments which we talk about the $1.776 million per year?"
Kevin Theiss,1,"[Foreign Language]
So, this $11 million we are reporting is for historical since 2007 until 2017. So, this -- again this $11 million is for the past 10 years for 2007 and 2017, this past 10 years. And we have eight years window to pay them off. So split it up 10 years amount will be paid in the coming eight years spread out. So, the direct impact to the ongoing year and quarter is quite minimal. And in terms of going forward, there's no clarity at the moment whether there will be further tasks, these type of tasks, but again, this is -- this not just for us, this is for all the U.S., American companies have a subsidiary oversees and we happen to be in that category."
Operator,1,"[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of [James Duran], a private investor. Please proceed with your question."
Unidentified Analyst,1,How you see all their today?
Kevin Theiss,1,"[Foreign Language]
Yes, this Ms. Yu is here."
Unidentified Analyst,1,"Okay because I didn't quite hear that before, but do you still having your stock in after hours?"
Kevin Theiss,1,"[Foreign Language]
Yes, we haven't look into that."
Unidentified Analyst,1,"Yes, your stock is down almost 19%. I mean I've been holding your stock for the long-time between me and another person I advice I hold about 300,000 share and let me be frank, I am not happy with your performance. Okay and I don’t think the market is either, a year ago you guys were between $8 and $9 a share, you are seeing it about just above 3 bucks right now. Does now registered anybody had there that the markets is telling you, you're not doing a good job, your expenses are growing significantly faster than your sales. When you've got the sales and you've got the margins, but you are spending is out of control. I mean you guys have -- I think you guys have a risk of being sued or fiduciary reaching a fiduciary responsibility. And if that happens, you guys have no idea how much trouble you are going to be in. So I don’t know what you are thinking about on that end, but when you go from $9 a share to $3 a share in one-year and your sales are up, you are messing up big time. So my suggestion is that you guys put your heads on straight and get this figured out, the market has rejected your management team's performance period. So just figure it out because you're failing right now, failing badly. Do you get that?"
Kevin Theiss,1,"Understood, point is taken."
Operator,1,Our next question comes from the line of [Peter Cyrus] who is private investor. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst,1,"Well, I guess I go into your stock with longer than anybody else than I too have said to see it come down so much in price. I was actually pleasantly surprised by the results in the quarter looking at how bad the Chinese order market was in the last quarter. I guess I have a couple of questions. First question is, you seem to be this is the second quarter or third quarter in row that you've done very well in the automotive sector. Is your automotive business mostly aftermarket? Is it domestic? Where is the automotive growth coming from?"
Kevin Theiss,1,"[Foreign Language]
So you are referring automotive as the passenger vehicle or just general?"
Unidentified Analyst,1,"Yes, passenger vehicle."
Kevin Theiss,1,"[Foreign Language]
On after market segment, most of the growth was coming from the -- for passenger vehicles segment, most of the growth is coming from aftermarket. And that’s also related to our increased effort, increased campaign in the sales and marketing for the first aftermarket. And through this quarter, we have increased our selling expenses in light of market where all of our major competitors and smaller competitors are facing different degrees of challenges. We believe this is the opportunity for us to get greedy.
We are significantly briefing up our sales team, expand our aftermarket presence that show not only in the passenger vehicle segment, but also commercial vehicle business as well. The consolidation is going to happen and it's going to happen sooner than most people expected. So, we are very aggressive getting our aftermarket presence and distance ourselves from our next nearest competitors."
Unidentified Analyst,1,"The part of the answer to the last gentlemen's question about why your expenses are out of the line, is that you see that you believe that some of your competitors will go out of business and you are moving aggressively to take market share?"
Kevin Theiss,1,"[Foreign Language]
Thank you Peter for your questions. You are right we are taking this opportunity to squeeze out some of, many of the smaller competitors who believe in this environment many of them are facing life and death situation. So as a larger operation with significant market share like SORL, we should take this opportunity to significantly grow our market share."
Kevin Theiss,1,"[Foreign Language]
And also as we witness the Chinese OEM market after a blockbuster year in 2017 for the truck especially the heavy-duty truck sales reaching 1.1 million units. 2018, the growth has tapering off. So, and we believe and going forward the OEM market will start to cool off in China for the truck business in particular. And that being said, as we anticipating the changes in OEM market and there will be a lot of competitors of ours and had to allocate their production capacity and to pump up their product and shifted to the aftermarket international sales.
And that being said and we will expect them coming in very aggressively according to the aftermarket international markets. And so, we are taking that step ahead of done not only to defend our market share but also and more aggressively expanding our presence and through intensified sales and marketing. So that's part of our strategy. You will see results in the future quarters. It's just not happening immediately in this particular quarter."
Unidentified Company Representative,1,[Foreign Language]
Kevin Theiss,1,"[Foreign Language]
If you're interested, we have some data on major competitors in China quite a few of them, other large operation as well. Quite a few of them and there are public listed in China. In reviewing these companies results in the third quarter than competitors hours and then you realize why we setting up those strategies. To give you a bit of, a little bit color on those, one of our competitor it's called one, it's in the third quarter their revenue was RMB500 million it's on a year-over-year basis availability increased by 0.5%, however if you look at their net profit they were down 48% year-over-year.
And looking it into their projection, they believe their profit in the coming and for entire year 2018 is going to be down significantly as well and a lot of those the structure are coming from passenger vehicle sector because they are very large in that segment. Passenger vehicles sales have been down noticeably in 2018. There was another company and our major competitor also public listed it's called [indiscernible]. Their third quarter revenue was RMB777 million. On a year-over-year basis, they were down 4.3% and looking into their profit at the bottom line, they are on a year-over-year basis they were down 105%.
So this is what happening in the industry and we all facing the similar challenges, a slowing growth of passenger vehicle sector, they are tapering of course commercial vehicle sector. The higher raw material cost and on top of that, there will be the credit crunch for the small businesses. So, now looking to our business in the third quarter, hopefully, you can see some positive factors what we have accomplished, if just looking at the number last year. It really cannot justify what's really happening in Chinese market at the moment.
But again, we are continue to grow in a difficult market and we are seeing the opportunity as a aftermarket international market and so we are putting more resources into the areas again in this quarter it's not reflecting our sales growth in aftermarket and international sales is now reflecting our intensified campaign and expenses, but you will see this also in the future quarters."
Unidentified Analyst,1,"As I said, looking at the numbers I mean China Yuchai who is in the commercial vehicle market, they had strongly lowest revenues and I know what the passenger vehicles sales have been down like 10% to 11% every month. So as I said, I was surprised, I was pleasantly surprised that your revenues. I see that your inventories, you have a lot of raw material, you have a good amount of inventory and yet your projections for the fourth quarter just about the 100 million U.S. in revenue, 105 million. Is the -- obviously, adding inventory indicates at some point you're going to see a growth spurt. Is that reasonable to assume?"
Kevin Theiss,1,"[Foreign Language]
The short answer is, yes. We remain optimistic. We are able to sell those inventories and as our channels are strengthened our market share expanding so we are stocking up those inventories to sell feed those channels. So you will see those into the coming quarters."
Unidentified Analyst,1,"I have some more questions, but I'll get back in the queue and let other people ask questions."
Kevin Theiss,1,"Okay, thank you."
Operator,1,[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of [Richard Erickson] who is private investor. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst,1,"I wanted to find out that one of your competitors is in [indiscernible] Tenneco U.S. company, and if you look at the price earnings ratio between your company and the Tenneco company, yours is way much lower. Tenneco was 7.8 and your, you look at the future that you have I mean at 2.8 right now. And I look at that and I say, why is it so low. And I look at Tenneco and I see that they are giving dividends and you folks aren't giving dividends. So the question is to be competitive with them from a shareholder standpoint. Wouldn't it be good to share some of your cash via dividends?"
Kevin Theiss,1,"[Foreign Language]
At this moment as you see, we are quite aggressively expanding market share continue to produce gross and even look in this quarter three line of our business two out of three lines are significantly outperformed the market. So, we are allocating lot of capital into growth at the moment but when we achieve our targets and we will consider start declare dividends."
Unidentified Analyst,1,"Okay. So, I have a follow-up question if I could."
Kevin Theiss,1,"Sure, go ahead."
Unidentified Analyst,1,"Okay. I'm looking at the infrastructure projects that are either ongoing right now or going to be happening especially in the United States and also with China and its big infrastructure plans. And I look at that and that's one of the reasons why I bought into your company because I want somehow participate in that infrastructure movement. Can you tell me what your forecast is as far as these infrastructure plants, improvement?"
Kevin Theiss,1,"[Foreign Language]
Infrastructure has bought a big part of the market for the use of trucks and construction equipment. And we are -- our product has not only selling in China, we're also selling in Europe and U.S. So, we are deeply involved with the push up infrastructure development."
Unidentified Analyst,1,"Yes, I would think that would be a big market for you and that again is the incentive that I see for your growth and you know again I'm investing in you because of that."
Kevin Theiss,1,"[Foreign Language]
Yes, you are right on the China side as you know the governments initiative one by one policy is export in Chinese capacity to global market and a lot of those vehicles are trust simplest are going to those emerging markets. And those vehicles come with our breaking suspects, so that's why we're pretty optimistic about it. We are also proactively working with the OEMs, a global OEM. In Russia, we work with Kamaz and we're working out to developing our products and shifting to their vehicles, commercial vehicles. In India, we are working with all the top three players including Tata, Mahindra. In Korea, we are working with Daewoo. And also in China, we are working with the largest coach bus producers, [Iveco]‎. So, all of these are part of efforts to expand our market presence to different channels and our OEM relationship."
Operator,1,"[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of [Peter Cyrus], private investor. Please proceed with your question."
Unidentified Analyst,1,"I like end of the press release, you've talked about you hope that the United States and China settled their domestic, their trade differences because you think the United States could be an important market. Could you talk about how you see your business -- what the opportunity you see in the United States?"
Kevin Theiss,1,"[Foreign Language]
So, U.S. is a major growth market for us not only for now but also for future. At this moment, U.S. only accounts for 25% of our international sales. We are currently working with to U.S. truck maker, truck operator, fleet fight. We are also working with, not many people know about it, we are actually working with AutoZone and O'Reilly, and our product has been in the U.S. market. So, we are -- we think as we, yes, we currently indirectly will sell through AutoZone. So -- and we think this market is very important for us. Again, as we indicated in our announcement, we hope the U.S. China trade relationship will improve and we can continue to grow in U.S. market."
Unidentified Analyst,1,"So, 25% of your international sales into the U.S. that's a big increase over where it's been traditionally, isn’t it?"
Kevin Theiss,1,"[Foreign Language]
So, yes, U.S. market has been a market we put a lot of effort over these years. And the tariff impact at this moment, we have not feel anything at the moment. So, we will continue to grow in the U.S. market."
Operator,1,"[Operator Instructions] As there are no further questions left in the queue, I would like to turn the call back over to Kevin Theiss for closing remarks."
Kevin Theiss,1,I want to thank everyone for joining us tonight and we look forward to speaking with you again.
