Brett McGonegal,0,"Good morning.
My name is Brett McGonegal and I'm the Co-CEO of Ideanomics. Most recently, I was the Founding Member and CEO of Hong Kong Investment Bank, The Reorient Group which is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. At Reorient, I developed the group's investment banking business. Prior to Reorient, I was the Co-Head of Equity Sales and Trading at Cantor Fitzgerald in Hong Kong.
I was also responsible for the development of the firm's Corporate Finance Investment Banking capabilities. Prior to Hong Kong, I was the Senior Managing Director at Charles Schwab Capital Markets and helped build the large-scale institutional sales and trading platform that was sold to UBS in 2003. I'm also a frequent guest on Bloomberg and CNBC TV.
Business overview, Ideanomics has a tremendous opportunity ahead of itself that will be impactful in the coming quarters. We are determined to become a prominent global player in the FinTech service arena and the transforming digital economy through establishing a global compliant network of financial technology, user community and digital asset production. We intend to build the branded financial product group with access to leverage Blockchain.
To achieve this, Ideanomics provides an end-to-end platform-as-a-service FinTech solution which supports diverse asset verticals. With the comprehensive ecosystem of digital products and services, we are deploying traditional assets and capital into a new world paradigm for the benefit of the investment community.
Our strategy, Ideanomics has identified key industries which tend to benefit greatly from the development of the digital economy. To fully unlock the economic potential of various asset classes, we will create a FinTech infrastructure to deliver artificial intelligence grading services, asset origination, security token issuance support and distribution.
Additionally, by supporting and fostering digital communities globally, we can utilize our AI technology to assist financing, investment services and help create asset securitization. As the transition takes shape from conventional platforms to the digital universe, the investment community will look for institutionally credible counter parties to assist, guide and navigate the ever-changing landscape. It is our goal to become one of the premier trusted counterparties ushering in this new era.
Ideanomics will act as a bridge between the old and the new positioning itself to be a critical player in the institutional adoption of digital finance, while at the same time becoming a vital conduit for the next leg of digital adoption.
Now moving onto some third quarter operational highlights, 2018 has proven to be a transitional year for Ideanomics, that has seen us migrate away from the legacy business operations and onto a focus of digital finance solutions enabled by Blockchain and AI. As with any transition we have experienced some volatility as it relates to top and bottom line.
The rightsizing of staff levels as it relates to a legacy cable business. In addition to hiring a best-in-class executive team capable of positioning the business to be competitive and successful in 2019 has put a strain on the bottom-line performance and thus has resulted in us falling short of our previous forecast.
We want to clearly articulate to the investment community and take responsibility for failing to meet EBITDA guidance. We are making an earnings warning at this time. Federico, the CFO will address in more detail later in the call. We have experienced a shortfall in product creation that has led us to delay two anticipated products to be released to the market this year. We have addressed these issues and believe we have positioned the products for a successful launch in early 2019.
As part of our efforts to transform the business, we have been active in deal origination as well as targeting and acquisition of businesses which expand our strength and further increase our footprint in the industry.
To highlight a couple from Q3, the acquisition of Grapevine, which is a proven influential market platform and brand has brought us a great opportunity in the digital space. Also, the investment into ownership of Asia Times and establishment of a financial JV company together will allow us to put new products into the market. These two deals highlight our focus and access to digital media and distribution and will be important parts of our media branded product creation and distribution. Both investments will yield margin opportunities in early 2019.
While there are several other deals concluded in Q3. We have highlighted these deals I just covered as each of these represents a significant opportunity for Ideanomics that demonstrate to the market and our shareholders the applicability of our FinTech products and services to support large scale deal origination.
Collectively, these deals have the potential to realize significant revenues, improve the viability of our business model. While we are encouraged by our ability to capture these deals in a relatively short time span and we continue to pursue other opportunities, our product teams are focused on execution.
I'll now turn over to the moderator Tony. Thank you."
Tony Sklar,0,"Thank you, Brett so much. I am now going to turn the call over to our CFO, Mr. Federico Tovar."
Federico Tovar,0,"Thank you, Tony and thank you to everyone joining our call.
The third quarter was very much a transformational quarter marked by various investments across human capital and therefore infrastructure needed to build out our U.S. operations and the resources necessary to position Ideanomics towards unlocking FinTech related revenue. While we have already exceeded our top-line revenue guidance for the year, we did not generate a profit in the third quarter due to the transformation of the company is currently undergoing.
Nonetheless, we've had significant achievements across the following areas. Number one, we've been focused on building out a world class management team with deep capital markets expertise as well as Blockchain, FinTech and regulatory compliance experience needed to succeed in our market.
Number two, we've signed various deals that are helping to validate our new FinTech business model and position the company towards growth and profitability. Some of these include Grapevine and Asia Times with proven platforms, brands and underlying product. As such, we're completely focused and executing on our vision and building out our new digital products across these asset classes.
As it relates to the third quarter financial performance, revenue for the third quarter ended in September 30, 2018 was $43.7 million as compared to $30.2 million for the same period in 2017, an increase of approximately $13.5 million or approximately 45%. This increase was primarily due to our expanding business with consumer electronics.
Cost of revenue was $42.8 million for the quarter-ended September 30, 2018 as compared to $28.3 for the quarter-ended September 30, 2017. Our cost of revenues increased by $14.6 million, which is in line with our increasing revenue. Gross profit for the ended in September 30, 2018 was approximately $0.8 million or 2% as compared to the gross profit of $2 million or 6.5% during the same period in 2017.
SG&A expense for the third quarter was $4.3 million as compared to $3.7 million for the same quarter in 2017, an increase of approximately $0.6 million or 18%. The majority of the increase was due to our efforts in building out our management team in the U.S. and investing our establishing our infrastructure as part of our transformation year.
Professional fees for the three months ended September 30, 2018 were $1.9 million as compared to $0.8 million for the same period in 2017, an increase of approximately $1.1 million. This increase was related to public company reporting on governance expenses as well as legal fees related to our business transformation and expansion of ecosystem.
Our loss per share for the three months ended in September 30, 2018 was $0.10 per share as compared to our loss per share for the same period in 2017 of $0.05 per share. As of September 30, 2018, the company had cash of $15.7 million, total assets of $167.7 million and total equity of $43.4 million.
As mentioned earlier the stream in our bottom-line performance is primarily result of the investments needed to undergo such transformation as well as, a shortfall in product creation that has led us to delay two anticipated products to be released to the market this year, primarily due to the technical, legal and operational capabilities that are needed.
We have addressed these issues however and believe that we have precision of products for a successful launch in early 2019. The company is committed to the successful product launches to be done in a regulatory compliant manner, while continuing to enhance our legal origination activities well in 2019.
These deals have the potential to drive significant revenues for the business and prove the long-term liability of our Ideanomics business model. Over the past three quarters, Ideanomics has been able to continuous transformation from its legacy business to become a prominent player for FinTech services and asset digitization, through establishing a global compliant network of financial technology and digital asset production.
Our team of seasoned executives, digital strategists and technology leaders is key to the success of Ideanomics' transformation to become further westernized and we believe that this will assist in further positioning the company towards unlocking FinTech related revenue in 2019."
