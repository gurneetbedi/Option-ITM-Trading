Darren Throop,0,"Thank you for joining. Welcome to the Entertainment One Interim Results for the Six Months Ending September 30, 2018. I’m Darren Throop, the CEO, and I’m going to give you a business review and then I’m going to pass over to Joe Sparacio who will go through the numbers with you.
So, we’ve had a very busy first half, very good first half. Revenue was broadly flat, but we experienced 10% growth in EBITDA, and 160 basis points of increase in our margins. So, the business is transitioning nicely to high-quality content sold through various channels but we’re seeing very strong margin growth coming through the business. Family & Brands, 29%, both EBITDA and revenue growth half year on half year. Digital platforms are really are taking a lot of the content, so SVOD platforms, and I will talk about that little later.
Film & Television, revenue mix is happening, just pretty much exactly the way we anticipated. You see revenue slightly down and EBITDA really reflecting the film business, far fewer release in the first half compared to the same period in the first half last year. When we look at the second half, we’ve got a lot of momentum on Film & Television from a title specific standpoint, and I will get into that. The acquisition of Sierra/Affinity and Whizz Kid in the first half of the year significantly augments our management team and our creative powers as an organization. So, we’re happy to get that done.
Integration is on track to deliver £13 million to £15 million pounds of savings by 2020. Library value went up again, $1.7 billion, now plays $2 billion. So, that just really demonstrates the content that we are investing in has long-term high-quality value, and full-year performance is expected to be on management expectations, as usual.
I just wanted to remind everybody of this slide; this is probably my favorite slides that really does speak to what we do as an organization. We do a lot, but really at the center of what we do is high quality content. And from that high quality content idea -- that idea this generated, we can then help develop it, produce it and indeed monetize it at the highest level, and we touched all aspects of the content industry. Of course, we’ve got a family and a television, a film and music, digital businesses but we also have live touring businesses, licensing. We do our own productions, sync, publishing, everything. So, we touch the entire ecosystem and we do all of that in house. So, really that big blue box in the center is what we’re focused on, high-quality IP ideas that we can then help develop and monetize at most effective level.
I want to talk first about Family & Brands. It’s a picture of Cupcake & Dino, which is a brand that we launched on Netflix globally in the first half of the year; it’s doing very well, very strong continued growth across our Family & Brands business. Peppa Pig continues to broaden its revenue base. Revenues increased to £44 million from £35.4 million, mostly due to AVOD and SVOD deals. So, we are selling a lot Peppa Pig episodes to SVOD service providers globally. These platforms are all over and they are really after high-quality children’s program and obviously Peppa is one of the most loved brands in the world.
China in the first half of the year was a big driver of our growth. That market continues to develop. We’ve got 74 license agreements in place. We did a lot of SVOD deals there with Tencent, Youku, Mango, so really strong growth there. And it’s also still doing very well in mature markets like the UK and the U.S., the new content that we continue to add to the pipeline significantly, increased the exposure and visibility of the brand.
PJ Masks global rollout continues. Fair to say that that is also a global hit. We’ve rolled out some toys in the first half in China; we’re going to do a full rollout in the back half of the year. Revenues increased almost £30 million from £21 million in the first half last year. It’s a huge growth for PJ. It’s the fastest growing L&M brand both in the U.S. and the UK right now. The performance indicators are great and it has been launched in all the major platforms in China as well. Ricky Zoom is set for launch in 2019. In January, it will roll out around the world through FY19 and in the back half of the year. Next year, we will start a licensing merchandising program on that brand as well, and lots of new product coming through the pipeline. Couple of big points, 1.4 billion views for PJ Masks in China on SVOD, some big, big number for as long as it’s been there and over 1,600 licenses and we were at 1,300 last year at this time.
Outlook for Family & Brands, I mean, the driver for us this year really is China. We see China as a big opportunity. There’s new content of Peppa being -- continue being delivered, there’s another 117 episodes in production. If we look at China as a market itself, we’ve really got a full complement of products in the market with our toy product -- our partner Alpha. And next year, happily, it’s the Year of the Pig in China. So, on February 5th, with our partners at Alibaba, we’re going to be launching the Peppa Pig movie. It’s got some Chinese, a lot of action in it and some Peppa Pig episodes. So, we’re looking for big things. It’s also the 15th anniversary of Peppa Pig, so there’s parties and events planned all over the world to celebrate Peppa’s 15 years in existence. We’re really pushing hard on experiential, our deal with Merlin for instance where they’re opening theme parks, we’ve got the Peppa Pig show, we’ve got the PJ Masks show which is actually managed through our live division through and our music division. So, we’re seeing a lot of continued engagement for that. L&M continues to grow and we’re going to go wide in China in the back half of this year with PJ Masks, those YouTube views, or those SVOD views that we talked about are having a big, big impact in the marketplace. And of course Ricky Zoom is going to launch broadcast.
There’s also eight new brands in development, Ninja Express is probably the next one that you’re going to see but the team continues to find new creative ideas and iterate and develop those ideas and then bring them to market. And as I’ve said before, there’s quite a long period of time sometimes it takes to develop these brands, but it’s nice to see you’ve got Peppa followed by momentum of PJ, followed by momentum of Ricky Zoom and another brands coming through the pipeline as well.
Long-term drivers of growth for Family & Brands. The market is moving towards SVOD, not only in television but also -- in scripted television but also in preschool brands and we’re seeing that big, big desire for SVOD platforms to get family content on their platforms as they know what holds audience. This is a big opportunity for us. We don’t -- what we look for is as much engagement as we can get. So, we’ve got linear broadcasters, now we’ve got SVOD platforms and we’ve got things like YouTube as well. You put that altogether and it just needs more awareness, more visibility for our brands in front of our core audience, which of course are little people and families. Really critical to have that huge brand awareness when you’re talking to online retail platforms like an Amazon, they want to know that there is an awareness in the marketplace that when they put there -- our products on their marketplace is they get good sell through. Key drivers for our Family & Brands business, premium content, quality holds true in preschool properties just as well as a dozen scripted dramas. And we’re very, very focused on making sure that the writing the animation, the story itself is as high quality as it can possibly be. China is really emerging as a top tier market and could rival the U.S. It is difficult to find the KPI for China, huge marketplace, exploding middle class, big opportunity in China, very strong pipeline, as I talked about before, and we’re really pushing on diversifying our revenue base. Once we get that brand awareness, we want to push that brand as hard as we can through experiential all kinds of different awareness opportunities that we have.
Moving to Film & Television. In the first half, progress was solid. We continued to transition our film business, as we said many times before. Revenue was down, EBITDA was down that really reflects the decrease in number of films that we released year-on-year. Last year, we released 48 in the timeframe and this year we released 35, so significantly down. Big releases for us this year, which did well are The House with a Clock in Its Walls, through our Amblin relationship; and I Feel Pretty are couple of titles that did quite well for us. The big difference in our film business this year is the dramatic drop in transactional revenues. This isn’t exclusive to eOne, this is an industry thing where DVD is becoming a much smaller portion of the ultimate revenue that we’re getting through a feature film, which is what we’ve expected and is a big part of the reason that we’re moving our business away from a distribution model to more of a production model, where we’re going to own more of those titles and participating global rights.
On the TV side and on the broadcast and SVOD licensing side, you are seeing exactly what we anticipated as well, we’re seeing strong growth. So SVOD has an insatiable demand for new content, high quality content, both newly produced and library content. We’ve seen strong growth with revenue up 20% in the SVOD window. Production and another revenue reduced 26%. Really this is tough H1 comparable. You have seen strong production deliveries in the prior period like Atomic Blonde, Lost City of Z; last year also we’ve seen things like Sharp Objects et cetera, so just a tough comparable.
Music continues to grow nicely for us. Actually Chris is in the room today. So, it’s nice to see Chris here. Revenue is up 19% year-on-year, really speaking to the transition from physical to digital and most of that growth came through from digital. Chris and his team released 37 albums in the first half compared to 40 last year, and we are really seeing strong performance from this artist management including an artist called Jax Jones who is from the UK here and the other et cetera.
Television and film outlook. We’ve got a really strong slate coming in the back half, both for Film & TV. Fewer releases again in the back half. We’re guiding down to about 120 from what we said before was 140, but we got some great titles in the back half on film Green Book, Beale Street Could Talk, Stan & Ollie, which is a title that we produced here in the UK. And there is one other one I wanted to tell you about, Vice, which is the Dick Cheney story, which is hilarious. We’ve got new production titles which include Queen and Slim, which is from Makeready or Brad Weston partnership and we’ve got Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark, which is the Guillermo Del Toro produced title which is wrapped up production Toronto, which will be releasing next year.
Television slate looks as strong as ever. We are on target to deliver over 1,000 hours of both acquired and produced content, really big key scripted show for us, obviously, Designated Survivor season 3, which is now a Netflix global show. We’ve got The Rookie season 1, we’ve got Burden of Truth season 2, Private Eyes season 3, Cardinal season 3 -- or Ransom, season 3, sorry. So, very strong performance there.
Unscripted really took off again for us this year. We’re seeing demand from traditional broadcasters but we’re also seeing demand from SVOD platforms for unscripted shows. You’ve got Ex on the Beach, Siesta Key, Naked and Afraid continues to win ratings as well. And since in the first half or in the last half of last year, we did the Mark Gordon acquisition, we brought Mark on as the Chief Content Officer. And since that time, he’s been doing exactly what we expected him to do. He’s been developing and finding new high-quality IP for us to produce. We’ve got 60 high-end shows set up with various platforms and television stations around the world. It’s a big, big pipeline of high-quality shows. So, I’m glad -- I am happy to say that that relationship and Mark is doing a great job for us there with his team. I think that’s it for that outlook.
Further, music activities continue to expand. We’ve got H2 new albums from the Arkells, we’ve got Royce da 5’9”, and Wu-Tang Clan really diversifying the revenue base in music, music as part of that creative tissue that ties one together. We’re touring the live Peppa Pig-- our PJ Masks show through the live division that is part of the music group. We’re doing a lot more sync, a lot more masters, a lot more interaction between music and the rest of the groups. We’ve also got new live tour as the Nelson Mandela Exhibit, and of course PJ Masks tour that I talked about before.
We talked about the annualized cost savings, that’s as well on track for FY20. And investment content is moderated for the current year. Part of that is just the reduction of the film business. We’re going down from a 100 which we forecast before to £90 million, and you’ll see that continue, and we’re going to -- so you’re going to see investment in content go down, and investment in production continue to go up. There’s always timing things, and we’ve seen some of that in the first half of the year. But, that’s a trend that’s going to continue as we’re making that happen.
Long term drivers, the next slide. The industry, it continues develop and change at a breakneck pace for sure. I can tell you that the opportunity is as big as it’s ever been, if you’re in the content business, and we’re purely in the content business and really know others. If you see what’s happening with Disney; Hulu announced last week that they’re going to take their platform globally instead of just North America. Apple still has started to spend a lot of money on shows and we’ve set some shows up with them, but they still haven’t announced what their platform is going to look like. You’ve got Snapchat which the Makeready did a show for. You’ve got of course Amazon and Netflix and Time Warner, the Disney new platform. So, there’s so much opportunity in the marketplace right now. And from an outlook standpoint, I think we need to continue to do what we’re doing as a company, which is really double down on high-quality content and high-quality creative relationships and really become that home for the best creative minds in the world.
The investment is going to continue to go up in the marketplace. Our drivers from an eOne standpoint are relationships with creators, we’re very targeting our investments to where we think we get the best return, best kind of a transition from a pure distribution model and film to more of a production model and film. We really are spending a lot of money on development and early-stage ideas, so auctioning books, helping writers get their ideas to screen, doing first look deals, all kinds of deals. So, we’re continuing to do the same things that we said we are doing for many, many years. We’ve got one sales team that we consolidated a few years ago, runs here out of the London office, which is really maximizing our opportunity in those SVOD windows and those linear windows that we talked about before where we’ve seen 20% growth. So that was a good result for the Company. And we’re going to really leverage our scale by pushing for targeted cost savings and continue to migrate that model to a higher margin business. You’ve seen the basis points increase in the first half, you’re going to continue to see that as we move this business forward and we transition to higher-margin businesses.
One thing I want to touch it on before I pass it on to Joe is the independent library valuation. It’s up again this year to $2 billion. Again, that’s what I said at the beginning, it really does kind of exemplifies the fact that the creative materials and properties that we’re bringing to the market do have long-term value for the company and for its shareholder. So, it’s good to see that grow and I would expect it to grow again in the next coming year. And again that library valuation is till the end of March, our last fiscal year has nothing to do with what we’ve created or produced or delivered in this fiscal year, and you won’t see that until September of next year.
With that, I’ll pass it over to Joe Sparacio, our CFO. Thanks, Joe."
Joe Sparacio,0,"Thanks, Darren. Good morning, everybody.
As Darren mentioned, we continue to improve margins through the mix. Strong growth in the high margin family business, SVOD as well as cost savings in Film & TV of 2 million have contributed to an improved margin. This has been offset by lower revenues in the theatrical and transactional business, as Darren alluded to earlier.
The results for the first half in Film & TV have also been impacted by timing, and Darren mentioned that we anticipate the backend of the year to be strong. At the end of the day, margins were up 160 basis points and that resulted in EBITDA growth of 10% for the Group. Free cash outflow is up by roughly £21 million, a lot of that has to do with increases in working capital, which are timing difference. A lot of that change is due to the significant amount of SVOD deals that we’ve been executing in the marketplace where you have payment terms that will stretch out past the point of revenue recognition. So, an example, we did a number of deals in China towards the end of the half year. We delivered those materials, we recognize that revenue, but the payment stream is after the half year. So, in that case, in that particular case, we will liquidate 80% of that receivable by the end of the fiscal year. So, you are seeing a heightened level of working capital, but it’s being triggered by changes in the business.
Net debt is increased. Again, part of that, a big chunk of that was the completion of the Mark Gordon deal, which we did in the early part of this calendar year. That was about £74 million. Again, the remainder is the change in the working capital profile. Darren also mentioned the increase in the library value from $1.7 billion to $2 billion.
At this point, I just want to mention, we talk about the half year and the cadence of earnings. We’ve kind of given a goalpost of 25% to 30% half year, the first part of the year and then the remainder in the backend. And for this half year, we kind of landed towards the upper end. A lot of that had to do with some SVOD deals that we were able to pull forward that were originally targeted for the backend. So, in terms of the weighting of the earnings from the Company, we’re certainly consistent with where we’ve been in the past.
In terms of the individual line items on a revenue basis. Family & Brands experienced 29% growth year-on year, Peppa Pig was 18% year-on year and PJ Masks 44% year-on year. So, our two top brands continue to perform very, very well in the marketplace.
Retail, gross retail sales increased from 1.2 billion to 1.3 billion during the period. And as Darren mentioned earlier, we have a broad rollout in China in the back end of the year. So, we’re cautiously optimistic about that.
In the Film & TV area, as Darren mentioned earlier, H2 is loaded in terms of deliveries, releases and operating performance as well. In the theatrical area, lower number of releases contributed to the year-on-year decline. As Darren mentioned earlier, we released 35 films this half year versus 48 last year.
Transactional is down 45%, and that’s very consistent with the messaging that Steve Bertram the head of our Film Group on the commercial side mentioned at our Capital Markets Day in September. And it’s also very consistent what we had mentioned in our trading statement at the end of September. At that point, we had also disclosed that we anticipated a write-down of certain assets as it related to the home entertainment business of about £64 million. We revised that estimate down in the actual half-year numbers to £57 million, £4 million in cash costs remains the same. The reason for the change or the revision is just a different look subsequent to September 30th than what we had at that point.
As Darren mentioned earlier, strong broadcast and licensing revenue, up 20%, a lot of that is SVOD related; music is up 19% as well. So, a lot of the pieces within even the Film & TV divisions continue to perform at high levels.
In terms of revenue and EBITDA levels, currency really wasn’t an issue for the half-year, so it’s had nominal impacts on the Company’s operations. Snapshot of EBITDA, again Family & Brands were up 29% in revenues and 29% in EBITDA and you could see at the bottom, the margin increased a 160 basis points from 13.2% to 14.8%. As I mentioned, currency had very little to do year-on year, and this half-year -- we received the benefit of £2 million from cost savings.
In terms of cash flow, free cash outflow, if you will is at £88.1 million which is up versus the prior year of £66.1 million, a lot of that sits in the working capital line. And that’s just due to the number of SVOD deals that we’ve had during the period as well as other timing differences. I think the important point here is the Company continues to reiterate targeted net leverage at the end of the year at 1.8 times. So, this is a timing difference.
Net debt, typically at this time of the year, our debt levels are at their highest and then we begin to liquidate down right after, right at the beginning of new calendar year. So, this is not uncommon for us. As I mentioned earlier, a big reason for the year-on-year increase was the Mark Gordon transaction, which was completed in the second half of last fiscal year.
One of the items that I will mention is in the corporate section of our announcement this morning, we’ve indicated that the first call on our senior notes is coming up in the middle of December. That’s something that the Company is currently evaluating. And if the market is right, we may do something in that regard, but it’s something we’re considering. If and when it happens, we will certainly provide additional disclosure. If we were complete a transaction like that or refinancing, we will probably have an enhanced leverage ratio at the end of the year, but we anticipate it would be under 2 times for sure, so not a big moment. And lot of that growth is because of the costs and expenses of doing a refinancing.
In terms of outlook for the year. There’s been some tweaks, as Darren mentioned, to the capital spend estimated in the various parts of our business. The one item that I will focus you on, you will see number of unique theatrical titles expected to go down from 80 in our initial guidance, down to 60. Again, that’s in keeping with the Company strategy to be very, very targeted in terms of where we place our bets in the film space. You will also notice down below an estimate of one-off items of £65 million; through the half year, we incurred 59.4 and we put a placeholder room for the back end of the year. We could come in lower than that, because we’re still going through the integration process with Film & TV. So, there may be some additional severance et cetera.
So, in summary, the half year, we continue to have robust EBITDA performance. Family & Brands continues to perform very strongly, driven by multiple revenue streams, growth in the digital platforms and experiential revenues developing. Ricky Zoom targeted for initial broadcast in the spring summer of 2019. In Film & Television we’re experiencing revenue mix, as the industry evolves, the film slate continues to transition as planned as home entertainment declines.
Film & TV business is balanced by strong growth in the SVOD platforms as well as TV broadcast sales. And we continue to have strong growth in our music division as well. Again, as I mentioned earlier and Darren mentioned in his remarks, we have a very robust development pipeline in Film & TV to drive future growth. Some of that you’ll see coming through in the half in the back end of the year. As Darren mentioned, we’re still on track to deliver £13 million to £15 million of cost savings by the end of fiscal ‘20. The independent valuation of our library is up again this past year from $1.7 billion to $2 billion. And our financial performance is on track and in line with our original expectations. There’s been no change in that.
And with that, I will turn it over for questions."
Q - Ian Whittaker,1,"Thanks, it’s Ian Whittaker from Liberum. Three questions, please. First of all, you said in terms of EBITDA margin you would expect that to continue to rise. So, are there any sort of levels of EBITDA that you’d expect that you wouldn’t share with us that you expect the business get to medium term in terms of your thinking? And the second thing is just in terms of the fewer films. So, obviously sort of you are taking more targeted approach. I guess, the flip side of that could be that therefore sort of it could increase the risk in terms of the portfolio effect. Just wondering how you mitigate that risk moving forward, with regards to your business? And I guess, third thing is sort of bigger sort of picture question. When you look at your business at the moment, what areas do you think there are gaps in which you’d like to fill, which realistically you could fill and whether you have the balance sheet flexibility to do so?"
Darren Throop,1,"So, on the margin growth, you’ve seen a shift in the business itself, so a part of that is cost, you’ve seen £13 million to £15 million of savings by FY20. Obviously that’s going to -- if you got the same run rate, that’s going to enhance your margins, but the other thing you’re seeing is the shift in the mix of the business itself. So, the SVOD sales are higher margin, lower revenue but higher margin business, and there’s a bigger contribution from the family business, which again is low revenue but very, very high margin. So, we’re not giving any guidance on where that margin is going to end up but we do expect to continue to grow.
On the second question on film, on the transition of film business, we apply the same risk profile to the production of a film as we did to the acquisition of the film. And by that I mean, we will look at a budget and say the budget is $10 for a film, we’ll look at our own territories and look to our own creative teams to make sure that it is a film that we think that will do well in a marketplace, such as the UK, like Stan & Ollie. We will make contribution to the budget of that -- for that specific film. And then the rest of the territories, the rest of the world, again we’ll sell through our international sales organization, which was until we just brought them into the team the Sierra business that we completed about six months ago. So, we apply the exact same risk profile and indeed, we don’t take flyers on things that says well it is $10, I think it’s going to be good, so let’s spend the $10 and then find out. What we’ll do is we’ll pre-sell a large portion of the world, excluding our territories to bring down that $10 risk to something that is palatable the same way that we did on film distribution. So, the risk profile is exactly the same, and I don’t want the inferences that we’re getting crazy risky here because we’re not.
The last part about holes or places to augment the business. We’ve really worked hard on bringing in a management team, both on the Family & Brands side and the Film & Television, and music side of things. And I think we’re properly geared. We’ve got a great management team. We’ve got tons of creative relationships. I think, what we could do and what we will continue to do is make more of those high-quality relationships as an organization, but really what we need to do is there’s a tremendous opportunity in front of us, based on just the demand and the new platforms and the new channels and the new deliveries, the consumer behavior. We just need to execute, we just continue to execute. Our balance sheet in good shape. Joe went through the 1.8 times leverage. It will come down. We said, we’ll push it down again next year. The balance sheet is in good shape and most days our equity is in pretty good shape too. So, I mean we’re in a good spot from a business standpoint and strategically we’re very, very well placed in a rapidly growing industry."
Bridie Barrett,1,"Thank you. Bridie from Stifel. So, just on family, a few questions, if I might. Nearly 30% growth in the first half of the year and seems that you’re quite positive about the impact of Asia and China in H2. Do you think you can keep up that pace in the second half? And also, I was wondering if you wouldn’t mind sharing roughly the split in the family between TV rights, licensing and royalties, and really just to kind of get a sense of potential cyclicality in that business and the royalty side of things? And then, finally, on the SVOD deals that you’re doing more generally across the group, which have come through and licensing and FTD now. Can you give us a sense of what share coming from SVOD? And reason being, I just think it would help us understand the working capital momentum that we understand the nature of that beside that business."
Joe Sparacio,1,"I would say on the disclosure point regarding SVOD versus broadcast, that’s a discussion we need to have internally. It’s not disclose today, and we need to talk about that because there may be some competitive reasons why we don’t want to disclose that. So, let us take that away and we will get back to. And it’s the same thing in terms of licensing in the family group versus SVOD. The only thing I will say as an indicator is that licensing continues to be more than 50% of the revenue stream in that business."
Darren Throop,1,"And the performance in the first half of 29% revenue and EBITDA growth, a bit of an anomaly because of the SVOD transactions that happened late in the first half. So, a big spike in both revenue and in EBITDA simply because you would actually deliver and book all of that. It does have that negative impact on working capital because you don’t get paid for it yet. So, that’s why you’ve seen such a big spike. We’ve been pretty consistent, we like to see 10% to 15% growth is what we continue to forecast. So, we would expect the family business to normalize over the back half of the year, more to a consistent growth rate. However, we left to be suppressed on the upside as well."
Unidentified Analyst,1,"Thanks. It’s Tom here from Citigroup on for Catherine. First one, on that SVOD point, I mean, you made the point that you’re trying to make content available over YouTube and other three platforms, yet you’re also monetizing it via SVOD. I was just wondering is there any extent to which that SVOD might prove untenable with you are making content available across other platforms, the three? That was the first question. The second one was on just specifically, you said, obviously there is growth in experiential and live events from the Family & Brands, but you said some -- I think you said some of that is coming through the live event part of the music. Does that mean you’re recognizing growth in both areas, and the elimination [ph] from that. And then, very finally, on music. Obviously, you’re doing a lot in terms of sort of 360 degree deals with artists, artist management et cetera. But pure recorded music, beyond the release schedule, are you seeing any change in the sort of the economics of recorded music, are you having to get more the economics…"
Darren Throop,1,"On the first question on SVOD, YouTube, while YouTube is -- some of it’s UGC content, so the customers are -- our customers are actually uploading the content to YouTube themselves. But, YouTube is not free. It’s really an AVOD supported mechanism. So, we do get revenue from YouTube as well. For us and -- so SVOD wants to capture their customer and get a subscription fee on a monthly basis. AVOD provides it free to the consumer, yet they’re paying with their time to watch ads. For us, it’s really about engagement. So, if we can have a world where there is a strong linear platform like a Disney or a Nickelodeon tied to a very strong SVOD second window perhaps where they’ve had first run at Disney or Nickelodeon and then we put on SVOD for second window and the added engagement of YouTube. That’s the best of all worlds as far as we’re concerned. So, that’s been a big change in the industry. The second question was, sorry.?"
Unidentified Analyst,1,[Question Inaudible]
Darren Throop,1,Yes. You can talk to eliminations…
Joe Sparacio,1,"The way that that would be split is the music group would get credit for the actual management of the show. So, they take their normal management fee and then there’s a royalty paid to the family group for their share of the earnings. That’s kind of how -- it kind of follows the economics of the deal."
Darren Throop,1,"And on the last question about recorded music and change in economics, I mean there has been significant rebound in music in the music business, largely again subject to these subscription services, Spotify being the biggest one and others coming on strong as well. The music team really approaches music as that 360 model that you talked about, where they’re touching many, many different aspects of the business, which is where we think the big growth opportunity is. So, let’s not just be specific on recorded artists, and you can see we reached almost 40 new albums in the first half, but also how else can we enhance careers through management, through sync opportunities, through publishing and indeed live touring and events, development of the business. Steve?"
Steve Liechti,1,"Hi. It’s Steve Liechti from Numis. Sort of talking about SVOD and family and stuff, I am almost surprised that you say it’s only around 50%. I know you said over 50%, but I implied it’s close to 50 than higher. I would have thought the other name, so I would be massively more than that, maybe I am wrong given the SVOD deals…"
Joe Sparacio,1,"[Multiple Speakers] As we said, we’re not disclosing number at this point."
Steve Liechti,1,"So, would it be fair to say that the SVOD being the super charger, I know you said about timing and stuff, but is it true to family that SVOD is being the thing that’s really taken that growth to almost above what we would expect in the mid-term?"
Darren Throop,1,"No, I mean, it’s -- again, I go back to the engagement point. SVOD is a low revenue, high margin business, license and merchandise is a higher revenue lower margin business, so they all contract different parts of that 29%, and 29% growth. So, SVOD was exceptional in the back part of the year because of the deals that we signed but that will normalize over the next period and the period after that. So, don’t look for anything -- that would normalize, but what that does do is it gives us great engagement within those territories that then in the subsequent timeframes drives license and merchandising revenues. So, it is just part of the puzzle and it’s just that it happened close to the end of the year. And when you see that 29% and 29% growth, we want to explain to you what happened, and it wasn’t an L&M that just went off the charts. It was because there were specifically some SVOD deals and that really drove the underlying earnings in that period. But really what we’re looking for now is that engagement that we’re going to get through those deals to drive the L&M revenues in half two and of course in FY20."
Steve Liechti,1,"And on the L&M, specifically China there, so just confirm, you’re confident, you are now able to get real money out of L&M in China that you’re now putting out that you think China L&M market could be as big as the U.S.?"
Darren Throop,1,Yes.
Steve Liechti,1,Good. Thank you. And then last one…
Darren Throop,1,You got me.
Steve Liechti,1,"Last one, just on Film & TV. Can you just give a update on The Rookie and also any comments on Amblin because it sort of feels like Amblin is being a bit slower than we would have hoped?"
Darren Throop,1,"Yes. On The Rookie, highest trending show is seven years I think on ABC on that time slot. So, launched very well, plus 3s, plus 7s came in very strong, so strong indeed that the network ordered another seven episodes of the back of the first two or three, which is good news for us. So, that’s going to full 20 episodes, which is great. Amblin is busy development, production, we did get House with a Clock in its Walls from them in the first half. The Amblin relationship brings us not only Steven Spielberg and his team but also Participant Media, because they are a big partner in the Amblin partnership. Green Book is a Participant title that is getting awards buzz. I’ve seen it last week, it’s fantastic. So I can happily say that there are a number of titles in later stages of packaging, getting ready for production and coming through Amblin relationship.
Okay. Well, I want to thank you all for coming. We will see you in May. Thanks."
