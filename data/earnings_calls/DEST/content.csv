Marla Ryan,0,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning everyone. I’m excited to be here with all of you as the CEO of Destination Maternity. Having only recently joined the company, three short weeks ago, I'm going to keep my comments this morning brief, providing an overview of my objectives and priorities to the business. 
As Dave will address in a moment, during the first quarter, the team made progress on several fronts, including reducing SG&A, operating income, and continued double-digit growth in our e-commerce channel. While I'm encouraged by the progress our team has made this quarter, there is more work to be done. In the past few weeks, I have begun a deep dive across the entire enterprise, immersing myself in every aspect of the business and getting to know our entire team. I believe Destination Maternity has the foundation of a powerful culture with extremely talented employees that will be critical to the future success of the brand. 
More specifically, I'm focused on working closely with all of our employees to refine and implement a comprehensive and attainable business plan geared towards accelerating revenue growth, rationalizing expenses and improving profitability. Given the importance of our enterprise wide transformation, we have formally created an office of strategic planning, which will report directly to me. The key function of this office will be to assist with all efforts related to specific initiatives needed to make our transition successful and swift. 
Let me breakdown some of my initial objectives for the business. First, we remain focused on growing and improving our e-commerce platform. Our e-commerce business increased 42.8% in the first quarter and we will continue to build off this momentum in the coming year. We are committed to continuing to drive significant improvements in our e-commerce business with revenue and the Motherhood brand reaching 50.8% comp year-over-year and A Pea in the Pod plus 21% year-over-year a testament to strength of this platform. 
Our brick and mortar business remains challenged, with declines in traffic and conversion. We continue to believe in the importance of having physical store fronts and will be focused on improving same-store sales performance. In the next few weeks, we will be implementing several tests to course correct these metrics. These tests will be focused on inventory increases behind our key drivers through increased conversion as well as new marketing messages to drive increased traffic to stores. Once we have proof of concepts, we plan to roll this out to the wider fleet. 
We are also focused on modernizing our in-store shopping layout and technology, while improving customer service to increase conversion. With this, we are embracing the digital needs of our customers and working towards implementation of greater engagement points during the 40-weeks of pregnancy and afterwards. This includes faster shipping solutions and enhanced online capabilities that will result in increased transactions and average order size. 
As an organization, we will be digitally driven using data first to inform decisions. We will deploy a test-and-learn culture that reacts upon proof of concepts allowing us to respond to selling trends, new concepts, buying behaviors and customer engagement much faster as we begin our journey to profitable growth. 
As we begin to reshape our infrastructure, we will instill an owner mentality into the organization that places a high emphasis on optimization, productivity and cost savings. Our transformation towards being more flexible, nimble and profitable organization will also allow us to be better poised for growth. 
As part of this process, we have kicked off an in-depth evaluation of all of our sales channels and revenue streams. We are assessing their profitability, growth opportunities, competitive strengths and weaknesses. This process will allow us to prioritize the highest performing channels. Additionally, we work quickly to implement a comprehensive brand vision that is reflected across every aspect of our business, our product, our e-commerce site, stores and marketing materials.
Our focus will be around innovation, providing solutions for the mom to be through our pillar products or key drivers which are currently a significant portion of our business. There is also tremendous opportunity to create more awareness through our own marketing, wholesale and partner businesses as well as joining forces with new partnerships. All of this is underway and we will provide a more comprehensive update as these opportunities come together later this year.
Finally, we believe in providing our mom to be with solutions that offer great value proposition. In the product engine portion of the business, our priority around inventory optimization, shorter lead time and improved product flow will be critical. These actions will allow for improved inventory productivity leading to a decrease on our dependence of promotions to drive sales which will in turn improve margin. 
As you can see, there is a lot of work ahead of us but I’m excited to be part of this organization and being part of real change. Destination Maternity is a business with vast potential and I’m committed to transforming this business into a more flexible, nimble and profitable organization that generates long term shareholder value. I look forward to speaking and meeting with many of our investors in the coming months. 
And with that, let me turn things over to Dave to discuss our financial performance in more detail."
David Stern,0,"Thank you, Marla and good morning, to everyone on the call. This morning, I will review our fiscal 2018 first quarter performance and other key items on our balance sheet and cash flow. Sales for the first quarter were 103.2 million, a decrease of 3.2 million or 3% from the comparable quarter last year. Comparable retail sales were essentially flat or down 0.1% which reflects the net impact of a 42.8% increase in e-commerce sales and a 9.1% decrease in comparable brick and mortar sales. 
Additionally, sales were impacted by the net closure of 27 retail stores, a decline in sales to wholesale and franchise partners and the prior year one-time revenue recognition of 800,000 related to a change in the method of accounting for gift card breakage. E-commerce sales represented 26% of sales in the first quarter of this year compared to 18% last year.
Gross margin for the first quarter was 53.7%, a decrease of 70 basis points from the same quarter last year. This decrease was primarily driven by the growth of our e-commerce business as a percent of our retail sales, partially offset by improved product margins within each channel driven by our reduced promotional activity.
Gross profit for the first quarter was 55.4 million, a decrease of 2.5 million or 4.4% from the comparable quarter last year. For the first quarter, 51.9 million, a decrease of 3.8 million or 6.8% from the comparable quarter last year. This decrease is driven by decreased employee cost and occupancy expense driven by store closures and ongoing expense reduction initiatives. 
As a percentage of sales, SG&A was 50.2%, a decrease of 210 basis points from the first quarter of last year. Adjusted EBITDA before other charges and change in accounting principle for the first quarter was 7.9 million, an increase of 1.6 million from the comparable quarter last year.
Net income for the first quarter was 0.2 million or $0.02 per share compared to a net loss of 1.1 million or $0.08 per share for the comparable quarter last year. 
Adjusted net income was 1.0 million, or $0.07 per share, compared to adjusted net loss of 0.7 million or $0.05 per share for the first quarter of 2017. 
Turning now to balance sheet, at quarter end, inventory was 66.4 million, a decrease from the comparable quarter last year of 7.3 million or 9.9% and debt net of cash was 40.7 million, an increase of 4.0 million from the same quarter last year. During the first quarter of 2018, we closed 3 stores and ended the quarter with 484 retail stores.
Capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2018 were 1.1 million, a reduction of 900,000 from last year. First quarter capital outlays were primarily the result of modest store investments as we optimize our real estate portfolio, as well as IT investments. These investments represent a measured approach to capital expenditures that we’ll continue as we move forward. 
This concludes the prepared remarks, I’ll now turn the call over to the operator to initiate the question-and-answer portion of the call. "
Operator,1,Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Doug Parker from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. 
Doug Parker,1,"Good morning Marla and team, appreciate you doing the call and congratulations. I did want to just get a little bit more color if you could talk and provide a little bit more on the SG&A front. I thought that that was encouraging given the trajectory of the way that you’re taking it and the way that you’re taking it and given the dynamics of the different channels and some other color that you talked about going forward. How do you think about SG&A kind of going forward generally speaking? What kind of range can we look for?"
David Stern,1,"Good morning Doug. It has been a continuous process. Yes, as we go back to 2016, brought down SG&A, 23 million; 2017 absolute dollars of SG&A were down even though it was 53-week year on the retail calendar which we follow. Then had about a 7% decrease in this quarter. And so, it’s really across the chain and across the organization. So, we look at this by line item at the home office, at the distribution center, at the stores. And of course, the largest drivers that I mentioned, employee costs and occupancy expense other large individual components. But it is an across the board initiative that everybody’s been focused on. So, we’ve been pleased with that result. 
We have not changed our forward look that we provided last time where we expect on an absolute basis SG&A to be down at least 10 million and that is inclusive of when I say on a net basis, it’s inclusive of expected increases where we see that maybe appropriate. So, for instance, if we’re pleased with specific marketing initiatives we’ll go ahead and invest in those because the goal, of course, isn’t to minimize cost, the goal is to maximize profitability. "
Operator,1,Thank you. And I’m showing no further questions over the phone lines at this time. I’d like to turn the call back over to Marla Ryan for closing remarks. 
Marla Ryan,1,"Thank you, everyone for joining us today on the call. While, there is much work to do ahead of us. I’m encouraged by our efforts today. Okay. Sorry. We’re holding here for a moment. It looks like there are…"
David Stern,1,"Well, it does look like there were a couple other questions. So, we didn't want to miss anyone. They joined a little late. "
Operator,1,And we do have a question from the line of Lee Lignos from Rubicon Cap Group. Your line is now open. 
Lee Lignos,1,"Thanks. Good morning. And Marla, congratulations on your new role and nice quarter. I had two questions, I guess really the first is with regards to the cash flow statement and this one is for CFO, David. It looks like there is an outflow, I'm trying to figure out the change of the accrueds in accounts payable. I think there was an outflow of $9 million. Can you give us a little bit more color on that?"
David Stern,1,"Sure. And that's just timing of when we're issuing checks. There were no specific changes. In fact, if you look back to accounts payable, the same quarter last year our payables are higher than the same point last year. So, I think what you're seeing is just fluctuations based on when the check runs happen to occur. "
Lee Lignos,1,"Okay, great thanks. And I guess the next question I have and obviously there is a pretty contentious proxy fight. And just kind of being part of that and looking at this, I think the net that I took away from the activist agenda was that there is an opportunity to get $2 of earnings power. And I'm trying to reconcile the difference, to reconcile the difference between previous management’s guidance and that $2. And I was hoping, maybe you could just for the benefit of the investors, try to explain to us some of the opportunities I guess on the top-line. And obviously your -- there are cost initiatives. I'm trying to figure out what's the key difference sort of between those two numbers? Because it's a pretty wide dispersion."
Marla Ryan,1,"So, I think, being here just 3 weeks and diving in with the team, it really is a process. This organization has to have a significant transformation in how we do business and how we bring product to the market. I view our market locations not just our owned retail stores but also our partners, our [niche][ph] locations, wholesale and truthfully our e-commerce. 
As many know, e-commerce continues to build, it is an important channel. It is incredibly critical to our current customer to spend 60% of her day on her mobile phone. And that is a very significant portion of how our channel sales come through as well. So, we have to optimize what we have today. And I believe that there is an opportunity to do that, but it requires us to connect all the different points throughout the organization to make sure that everyone is on the same page, that our messaging as we go through product, inventory, marketing, social media, paid advertising, our stores, our field team, customer service, the product, the specific product that we have, how we stand behind that, how we message that every day. Those are all very important pieces and it creates a circle from start and finish for us to complete how we deliver to the customer. We also need to be able to engage with her, we need to anticipate her needs, and need to be able to provide her with solutions. So, for me, it's a 360-degree process. I would say that we're in the beginning stages of how we implement all of those different touchpoints and initiatives so that we can have a very fluid 360-degree flow for her. "
Lee Lignos,1,"Great. And I know you've been -- and that's helpful thank you. I know you've only been there a couple of weeks but I guess in your kind of rough assessment, do you feel that the building blocks are in place or is there really a lot of lot of heavy lifting. And I guess to that end, what do you anticipate kind of the expense outlay for all of that?"
Marla Ryan,1,"I think building blocks are here. I have said this since my first sort of introduction to the organization: I don't believe that this is a broken company. I believe it is a company that needs to have tweaks and to really think transformationally as our customer continues to be much more digitally focused. That said, I would love for us to have zero-sum game. So, for whatever it’s going to cost us in future, how can we pay for it ourselves, but how actually having to take on more expense. As we’ve noted in the previous question you know the SG&A which I think we’re all clear is just far too high. How we go in and find optimization, how we go in and find productivity will be our first critical heavy lifting moment. But I think we’re fortunate that there are lot of systems in place, there are a lot of processes in places, I believe we have a talented team here in the organization. We have very willing vendor partners, who want to work with us and see us succeeded and I believe our customer also wants to see us succeed and continues to be happy with some of the progress that we’ve made. So, there is always heavy lifting in any transformation, but I think that we will be able to meet that challenge. "
Lee Lignos,1,"Great, well I really appreciate the color and congratulations again and we look forward to you next quarter."
Operator ,1,Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Cutshall from Swan River Capital. Your line is now open. 
Jeff Cutshall,1,"Hi, good morning."
David Stern,1,Good morning.
Jeff Cutshall,1,"How are you doing David? There's been a lot of focus over the last nine months about cost cutting, but sometimes additions are actually required to. And so, I’m curious as you look at the organization and granted you've only been there a couple of weeks but as you look at the organization, are there any voids or key roles you see that need be filled?"
Marla Ryan,1,"It is early in the process, and there are somethings that are sort of floating to the top. I do believe that as we become more digitally focused, we are going to make sure that we have the right marketing, advertising and that floats down to social and PR. I believe in today’s industry that marketing is almost as important as having the right product and, in our case, having the right solution. They go hand-in-hand, so we will be focusing a lot on our marketing area not only the talent but making sure that we have the right number of people and that they have the right skillsets and that we are delivering a best in ROI on whatever we spend in marketing but that is, it's in mind with our SG&A targets as we go forward. So, I could see some expense shifting from other areas of the company so that we can support the marketing team but our overall goal is to continue to reduce our SG&A to be much more in line with what we see from some of our better competitors who are doing best-in-class. "
Jeff Cutshall,1,"Okay, thank you. Good luck."
Marla Ryan,1,
Operator,1,Thank you and I’m showing no further questions. I’d like to turn the call back over to Marla Ryan for closing remarks.
Marla Ryan,1,"Okay. Thank you, Glenda. Thank you all for joining us today on the call. While there is much work ahead of us I’m encouraged by our efforts today. We are working hard to identify and implement the right processes and strategies that will unlock the true potential of this business and position us for long term success. I appreciate your ongoing support and we all look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter."
Operator,1,Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.
