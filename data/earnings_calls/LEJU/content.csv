This concludes our prepared remarks. We’re now ready to take your questions. Operator, please go ahead."
Operator,1,[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Binbin Ding from JPMorgan. Please ask your question.
Binbin Ding,1,"Thanks management for taking my question and congrats on the strong quarter. My first question is on your e-commerce. So can you help me understand the drivers behind the 57% growth? And is this due more coming from the low tier cities? Second question is regarding the impact from economy slowdown. So we’ve heard a quite a number of corporates [ph] indicating their cautious view regarding the 2019 outlook. So what is our current expectation on that? And on top of that, can you talk about the business outlook of both e-commerce and advertising segment in 4Q in 2019? My last question is, can you give us some color regarding the progress of Leju Finance in terms of traffic, monetization, outlook, etcetera. Any color will be helpful? Thank you."
Geoffrey He,1,"Thank you, Ding. For your first question, for the third quarter actually it is driven by -- because we’ve more projects in the lower tier cities. That’s the first one. And the second one is actually we see some opportunities in the first and second tier cities because the market has some change. And some projects begin to have some discount base. So this leaves us with space to sell the coupons. So it is the combination, but mostly I think from the projects from the lower tier cities, that’s the contribution, lower tier city contribution for the third quarter. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we already see the market is getting cool. So for us, the positive side is that -- its easier for us to have more e-commerce projects, because more projects begin to -- want to have discount, or provide discount to the consumers. So it's opportunity for us to sell the coupons and do the marketing. The negative side is that because the market is getting -- is going down, so the trading volume of each project is also getting down. So there's still a little bit uncertainty in the fourth quarter because it's a combination, even if we can sell the coupons, if the trading volumes getting down, so it will also influence our e-commerce revenue. So from current point aside, we tend to be cautious on the fourth quarter, but I think in general for us, the e-commerce business for us, the trend is I think is positive. As to the third question, that’s also on the -- also answer the fourth quarter outlook question. For the third question is that, Leju Finance is only 1-year, but I think we already laid a quite solid foundation for our future business, because first is we focused on the content contribution in deep industry content and spread of the news to the mass media. So that help us build up the inference. Second is we are gradually building up the new revenue source. First is from the branding market, I think we’re getting some monthly fee charged from the big name developer. The second is, of course, we are trying to set up a platform to connect the developers with the capitals and with the markets. So we hope in the near future, we will have some new type of revenue from that. In general, I think we still need some time to gradually to build up this platform. So from current time of point, I think, Leju Finance for us, it's inference is more important than to revenue contribution."
