Wenbin Chen [Interpreted],0,"Thank you for joining today’s quarterly results conference call. Entering the first quarter of 2018, Yintech continued its focus on providing investment and trading services to individual customers. The five business lines across our two major segments, commodity services and securities services have all being developing healthily.
In commodity services, our customer trading volume and net commissions and fees dropped sequentially, mainly because our customers trading activities were adversely impacted by unfavorable market conditions, as well as the Chinese New Year holiday. 
We started to consolidate Forthright Securities, the results of operations during this quarter, which strengthened and diversified our securities services business. Other business lines under this segment, namely our Securities Advisory and Securities Information Platform business and Asset Management business are also growing steadily. We expect Security Services to contribute more than 30% of our overall net commissions and fees in the second quarter of 2018 as they become our major growth engine. 
We continued our emphasis on producing solid comp and research in order to provide our customers with timely market information, comprehensive research analysis and investment process suitable for various levels of knowledge and experience. As a result we should be able enhance customers trust in Yintech and stickiness to our platform therefore reducing our overall customer acquisition costs. 
Recently Yintech and Value Cloud [ph] entered into a framework agreement on high Level Corporation. Pursuant to this agreement Yintech and Value Cloud [ph] will explore the application of artificial inelegance in the financial industry and together promote the innovation and development of China’s Yintech sector by leveraging their respective advantages in financial services and artificial intelligence. 
This corporation will enhance the development and application of artificial intelligence in Yintech business areas such as Knowledge Graph, Intelligent Customer Service, Intelligent Quality Inspection and customer Relation Management, with an aim to provide customers with more intelligent and more accurate services.
In addition, we are pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has appointed Mr. Yonghong Fan, a veteran of China’s financial industry as our independent director and audit committee member. Mr. Fan has over 30 years of experience in the finance and investment industries, including managerial positions in commercial banks, securities firms and firm’s management. We strongly believe Yonghong’s deep experience in managing a wide variety of financial institutions, especially securities firms and fund management firms and his in-depth knowledge of investments and research acquired over a long and successful career will bring significant value to Yintech’s expansion in securities services business.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Interim CFO, Hongchen Yu to discuss our financial results during the first quarter of 2018. "
Hongchen Yu,0,"Thank you, [inaudible] and thank you all for joining today’s conference call. I will first walk you through our first quarter 2018 financial performance, followed by our guidance for the second quarter 2018 and the new share repurchase program. 
In the first quarter of 2018 Yintech generated revenues of RMB269 million, a 30% decrease compared to the previous quarter. In our commodities services segment customer trading volume for the quarter was RMB500 billion, a 30% decrease compared to the previous quarter. 
Effective fee rate for the quarter was 0.04% compared with 0.038% in the previous quarter. As a result, our new net commissions and fees from this segment were RMB198 million for the quarter, a decrease of 28% from the previous quarter. 
In our Securities Services Segment, net commissions and fees for the quarter were RMB45 million, an increase 247% from the previous quarter. The increase was due to the consolidation of Forthright Securities results of operations, as well as organic growth in our Securities Advisory and Securities Information Platforms Services Business. We’d expect this growth momentum to future continue in the coming quarters. 
Expenses for the quarter were RMB309 million, a decrease of 27% from RMB421 million in the previous quarter. The decreases were mainly due to cost control measures implemented on advertising and promotion expenses, as well as variable components of employee compensation and benefits.
Net loss attributable to Yintech for the quarter was RMB63 million compared to net loss of RMB64 million in the previous quarter. Non-GAAP net loss attributable to Yintech for the quarter was RMB29 million compared to net income of RMB61 million in the previous quarter.
As of March 31, 2018, we had a cash of RMB527 million and short term investments including available for sale investments and repurchase of government bonds of RMB1,340 million compared to RMB691 million and RMB1,212 million as of December 31, 2017 respectively. 
As of March 31, 2018 total shareholders’ equity was RMB3,604 million compared with RMB3,576 million as of December 31, 2017. 
Now let me turn to guidance for the second quarter of 2018. Based on our current and the preliminary view, in the second quarter of 2018 we expect revenues to be in the range of RMB280 million to RMB300 million. 
On May 29, 2018 Yintech’s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program effective June 2, 2018, which authorizes the company to repurchase up to US$30 million worth of it issued and outstanding ADS over the course of 12 months. This Share Repurchase Program extends Yintech’s previous share repurchase program that was effective for 12 months from June 2, 2017 and due to expire shortly. The share repurchase program will be founded with Yintech’s available cash balance. 
This concludes our prepared remarks for today. Operator, we will now open the call to questions. Thank you. "
Operator,1,"Yes, thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from Johnny Wong with Jefferies."
Johnny Wong,1,"Hi management, thank you for talking my question. Can I ask if we can have a breakdown on the – between the spot and futures business. We understand that during the last conference call, the trading in gold and silver, the activity was actually relatively low because of the lack of volatility. We wonder if this is still the case for this quarter and what have you seen in the second quarter, that’s my first question? 
And my second question is in regards to the guidance. The guidance of between $280 million to $300 million for the second quarter, again how much is that related to our Futures and Spot business and how much of that is our newer businesses, the Forthright business, thank you."
Hongchen Yu,1,"Thank you, Johnny. Let me translate the questions to Mr. Chen first. "
Wenbin Chen,1,"Hi Johnny, this is Wenbin Chen. So for your first question, the breakdown of our first quarter results of commodity services between Spot Gold and Futures, so the quick question is roughly 20% - 80%. So roughly one-fifth of the trading volume and revenue is from Spot Gold and you are correct, that is due to the low volatility in gold price. 
And for the second quarter the guidance on our second quarter, so between commodity services and security services the split is roughly 70% and 30%. "
Johnny Wong,1,So that will be 70% for commodity and 30% for security. 
Wenbin Chen,1,Yes.
Johnny Wong,1,"Okay, thank you. "
Operator,1,"Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Alright, as there are no more questions the present time – actually we do have a follow-up question from Johnny Wong with Jefferies. "
Johnny Wong,1,"Hi [inaudible], just a follow-up question. Now I see that our guidance for revenues is not that much higher than our first quarter. Now if we, given the pace, we think about maybe cutting back on cost, particularly Human Resources costs if we continue to see this trend of losses going forward. What’s our strategy there? Thank you."
Wenbin Chen,1,"Okay Johnny, please wait for one minute. Okay, let me quickly translate Mr. Chen’s answer. So the Security Services segment of ours is currently ramping up pretty quickly and it’s in its early development stage. So for this part we will not have a cost cut initiative, but rather we will actually invest more resources into this segment. 
So the reason second quarter revenue guidance compared with first quarter actual number does not seem a big increase, so that’s because our Security Services is still ramping up and we are actually networking some resources from the commodities business to our Security Services businesses. And also there is one thing regarding the nature of Security Services, because we had some subscription based services provided under this segment. So for this particular business, we received clients – we received cash from clients at day one, but actually the service will be provided over the next three or six month, which means we will have a observation schedule of the revenue. 
So right now we have the cash from the client, plus our revenue will be reflected in later months and later quarters and we think for the security services business we see the client base actually increasing pretty quickly and those will be reflected in the increase of revenue in the coming quarters. "
Johnny Wong,1,Okay. Thank you.
Operator,1,"Alright, and as there are no more questions at this present time, I would like to turn the call over [Inaudible] for any closing comments. "
Unidentified Company Representative ,1,"Thank you, Keith. This concludes our call today, thank you all for joining us and for your interest in Yintech. Good morning and good night. "
Operator,1,Thank you. This conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.
