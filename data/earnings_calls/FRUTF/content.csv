Mr. Yehudai, would you like to begin?"
Ori Yehudai,0,"Yes, good afternoon and good morning everyone. I just want to add my friend here Mr. Roy Meltzer, VP of IR and Business Development also with us. I am delighted and very thankful for your participation in presenting the Frutarom results for the first quarter and maybe more important few words that maybe I am allowed to say about the potential and possible merger with IFF.
So the first quarter 2018, additional milestone in our journey of fast growth while improving sales, improving profits and so on as we have been able to do over the last couple of years following a good implementation of our strategy, combining profitable internal growth double then the growth in the market where we operate, together with strategic acquisition that bring additional record quarter double-digit growth in sales, profits, and nice improvement in margin.
On 7th of May three weeks ago, we signed an agreement -- merger agreement with IFF, a merger that is very exciting for me personally for us as management, a merger that will bring about the biggest fastest growing and most profitable company in our industry, and I will be happy to elaborate later on how I see the possible merger. But allow me to go back to Frutarom as a standalone since, till the merger happened Frutarom has managed completely separately from IFF. So, we are very pleased with the continued organic growth in Frutarom, our taste flavor division 73% of our total sales grew by above 8%, and our natural fine ingredient grew by 8.5% and already 22% of our total sales.
Total internal growth in our core business 8.3%, no doubt double than the growth of the world is seeing in the relevant area where Frutarom operate. We are also quite please to see the improvement margin following the growth in the business. A record EBITDA in our core business for first quarter by the way should be our weakest quarter definitely not one of the strongest one. Typically, the second and the third are the strongest one. In the first quarter, we achieved 22.2% EBITDA margin in our core business compared with 19.7 in the parallel quarter, supported by a handsome improvement in the EBITDA of our natural fine ingredient jumped from 19% EBITDA last year to 25% EBITDA this year.
This comes mainly from two main projects. One is good integration of Enzymotec, which we said we've contribute at least 1% to the total gross margin and EBITDA and EBITDA margin of Frutarom, but of course a much more significant influence on fine ingredient business. And the good implementation on the project that is one of the most important one, we are working on last two years of our natural botanical extract business that are growing double digit over the last couple of quarters including first quarter. And I'm happy to say continue to see that growth both in Enzymotec and in our natural botanical extract business.
In our taste division, 21.1% EBITDA compared with 19.7 in the first quarter last year supported by the internal growth and the integration that was implemented over the last two years. We strongly believe our profit and margin will continue to improve in the rest of the year supported by the full synergies from the integration of Enzymotec that is now already into place, and the integration and the botanical extract project mainly following the closure of the expensive Swiss, Wadenswill operation that should be shutdown at the end of June. And as of the second half of the year, we will see on a yearly basis saving of $6 million that will come to the bottom line that we don't see right now.
We also feel very confident that the internal growth will continue in a nice way. The improvement in profit and margin will continue and 2018 will be another record year for Frutarom in all parameters as we expected. The internal growth and the improvement in margins coming from several main factors and I will go over them very quickly. Focus on natural product and special solutions in the area of taste, nutrition and health and the combination of product that we tailor-made for our customers, 75% of our business today with natural products. This percentage, this percent go up every year and I believe we will continue to go up while we invest more and more both in R&D in acquisition and in capacities to grow our natural solution business both in fine ingredient and in the taste business.
The second important differentiation of Frutarom is our customer focus. Over 70% of our business with smaller local food and the other companies special emphasis on the private label sector about 25% of our total sales and this type of customers are growing in the last year at a much higher rate than most of the multination that our bank from Frutarom typically niche added value solution and Frutarom is not the core list of these customers by the way I open record opposites to IFF.
And on top of that very, very significant opportunities in cross-selling that are contributing nice part of the internal growth. We nominated business managers for each of our products category and technology, and the work between them and the local sales people 1,200 sales people serving 35,000 customers in 160 countries is going much better than before, and we see the results in the fruits and I think it’s only the beginning of that.
The third element is improved geography mix higher portion in emerging market that are reaching almost 45% and the higher sales in North America helping us to improve internal growth, organic growth as we are seeing. The integration and the efficiency program are contributing to the improvement in profit and the margin. Following the faster internal growth over the last two years and the 14 acquisitions, we implemented since the beginning of 2017. Our sales revenue on a pro forma basis 2017 is above 1.5 billion and that’s before a contribution of the internal growth of 2018, but as you can see, it’s quite sizeable and added to the 1.5 billion.
Based on our strong competition situation increased internal growth, the acquisition we made and the strong pipeline of acquisition we will be making, and the contribution of the efficiency program including the global purchasing that we are building, we believe we’re in the right way to achieve our 2020 goal, to achieve sales of above $2.25 billion with EBITDA margin in our core business of above 23%. By the way, I believe this number will be achieved much before 2020. And if you look at the first quarter, if you look at last year, you can see that the trend is there and the 23% EBITDA core will be achieved before 2020.
Frutarom is entering into 2018 in its most in the strongest position we ever seen, we’re growing faster, our turnover double itself again in the last four years. Strong experience committed management improvement in our core business and its profitability that will continue to improve in the rest of the year. Stronger global operation 74 production sites, 93 R&D lab, 111 sales and marketing offers supporting our 35,000 customers, 12,000 of them were acquired in the last five years through 38 acquisitions that we made. And I mentioned before, the main differentiation of Frutarom with customers and product and solution.
If I go to the first quarter results, sales grew by 27% reached $385 million organic internal growth excluding currencies and acquisitions in our core business 8.3%. Our taste business growing at a CAGR of 24% a year since 2000 and already 73% of our total sales achieve growth of 28% reached 281 million with organic growth of 8.1%. Our fine ingredient growth of almost 30% which $87 million, internal growth 8.5% and the fine ingredient is already 22% of our total sales, this number I believe we will continue to grow with the actions that we are taking. While we exclude some minor one-time effect mainly connected to the botanical extract projects and the closure down of Wadenswill that is mentioned, will bring 6 million to the bottom line as of the second half we see an improvement in our profit and the margin in our core business.
Gross margin in our core business grew by 34%, gross margin 41.9% almost 42%, EBITDA a jump of 44%, EBITDA margin 22.2% and net profit for the total company increased by 35% and reached $46 million with net margin of above 12%. Our growth strategy as mentioned before both in product, we continue to grow our flavor business, entered into several new markets for Frutarom like France, Thailand and Vietnam through several acquisitions. Several other acquisitions are strengthening our position in existing markets like Brazil, UK, Switzerland and the South Africa and Sub-Sahara. In December, we agreed to acquire Bremil, the largest savory solution business in Brazil. This acquisition will be finalized hopefully in the next coming few days and will allow us again to be the leader, the leading player in savory solution in Brazil with very good access and relationship with the largest meat processors and the ready food, ready meals manufacturers in this important country and the region.
When we go to our specialty and depreciation in products, we built the leadership position over the last few years in natural food protection, natural antioxidant, preservative and protecting food, all natural replacing synthetic, entered into the natural color and became one of the largest five players in the area. Recently, we finished building a compounding an application lab in our production site Etol in Slovenia that will be our European center and will allow us to penetrate with color solution to our customers, not only with single color that are extract, this will allow us both to grow faster and more importantly to improve margin on our natural color and some additional moves very interesting acquisition in the active cosmetics ingredients required IBR in Israel with very nice product lines, very unique natural extraction with clinical studies.
Last year, the Company grew by 40%. The growth that we are seeing in the first quarter is very, very nice double digit growth that we believe will continue for 2018 and that is before us. A very nice growth in our biotechnology algae-based business, again for active cosmetics, we're about to sign additional contract that will increase our sales by 50% and these are also very very profitable products. All these natural solution clean labels are what billions of consumers want to see in their food and the demand to replace synthetic chemically based product to natural product that are more than 75% of our total sales.
Few words with your permission on Enzymotec, the acquisition we finalized at the beginning of January, an excellent acquisition, a very good implementation integration into Frutarom, a very very nice pipeline of new products supported by $30 million invested in R&D with 160 patents for unique products in the nutrition ingredients and food supplements. We entered into the fascinating area of infant and elderly nutrition that is growing very, very fast primarily in China where we are increasing our market share and the business again very, very nice double digit growth.
The partnership we have in the infant nutrition with AAK, the Swedish company was enlarged recently for additional five years with a clear plan to increase production capacity that is needed in order to meet the demand that we are seeing now and we'll see in the near future. We are going to launch this year at least two new products after 10 years that Enzymotec did not launch any new product on top of the main product the infant that itself are going very, very nicely. We work on cross-selling with many customers of Frutarom and Enzymotec on food supplements, nutrition ingredients, and are very pleased with the results that also you can see and the contribution that you can see in the first quarter that will be boost in the second quarter and going forward.
While we work on the focus on the Enzymotec, we decided to sell the krill business. Last year's sales $6 million, a loss, we sold the business for $26 million and more importantly free-up half of the capacity in the nice $40 million investment in Enzymotec. We will use this half to move other production from other sites while improving our efficiency. This will happen within the next 6 to 9 months. Frutarom Israeli headquarter was already merged with Enzymotec. We changed management and we continue to work on the optimum efficiency from combining the Enzymotec operation with the Frutarom. I mentioned before, the interesting acquisition of IBR. Again, we are moving some of the production to Enzymotec. We have a lot of synergies and many cross-selling with customers and products.
On the geography side, we continue to see a very nice growth in emerging market. In the last five years, sales to emerging market grew by more than three times and that are today 45% of our total sales. In Asia, we achieved in the first quarter growth of 26% combination of fast organic growth, supported by our new site in China, cross-selling opportunities and acquisition. About 10% of our total sales today are in Asia much below what we want to have, and if the deal with IFF happens, of course the strength of IFF in Asia will bring us another jump in this very important fast growing area.
Latin America in the last five years, we increased our revenue by 7, supported by 7 acquisitions. In the first quarter, sales grew by 33% and Latin America is today around 15% of our total sales compared with around zero in 2010. The acquisition of Bremil that I mentioned before, it will be implemented in next coming very short period. We’ll contribute to our leadership position in the several areas in Latin America. We’re happy with the growth we're achieving in Africa. In Central and East Europe where we are the leader player, both in Central and in East Europe, we see nice growth there that help us to achieve the results that we are showing the same happen in North America in the last five years. Our sales grew in North America by almost 4 times and our flavor sales grew by 11 times since 2010.
To some up, we are happy with the first quarter results that represent a good implementation of our growth strategy and other milestone in the journey that Frutarom is taking over the last 30 years. We are optimistic about 2018 that will be another record year for Frutarom growth because of the internal growth, the uniqueness in product, our ability to give tailor-made solution to our customers cross-selling opportunities, a very good pipeline with thousands of customers, a better geography mix, operational efficiency, global purchasing and additional strong pipeline of acquisition supported by stronger cash flow and very nice pipeline of acquisition that we’re working on all the years around 200 companies on our short-lift out of 1,200 potential out of them 20 in several stages of negotiation and we hope to see additional acquisition in 2018.
Much more than that, we are very excited and looking forward to the Frutarom integration with IFF that I believe personally and we believe as management is another milestone, significant milestone in our growth story. This merger with IFF will create the largest global company in the areas of flavors, fragrances, natural, fine ingredient including for nutrition, for health, for taste and of course for sales that IFF is one of the global leaders. I strongly believe that the combine company will be fastest growing and will have the highest margin in the industry, and I’m sure that the new merged company will bring very nice value creation to all stakeholders including our shareholders, our employees and our customers.
We have to remember the main logic for this deal is about faster growth both internally and through additional acquisition. It's very, very important to mention and to evaluate that Frutarom business and IFF business. The two companies are very complimentary one to each other. They are very little overlapped between the activities of the two companies and I will mention few of the main elements. Talking about customers, IFF is a global leader with the large global companies and it's on our core list of most or all, the multinational while Frutarom is not on the core list of any of them, and only less than 30% of our total sales are with the multinational typically niche added value solution that the other large companies don’t have like natural solutions and others.
Over 70% of our sales with smaller, mid-sized, customers, private label customers that are growing much faster than many of the multinational, so that together while keeping the frontend and the service to the customer to both customers, to the IFF large customers in the excellent way that IFF used to do and to the service to the Frutarom customers in a very good way that Frutarom give the right support, the right value, the right service to our customers. The frontend will be maintained in order to achieve the internal growth that we are achieving up till now with additional very, very significant cross-selling opportunities that Frutarom has before and with IFF, we have much more together.
I believe that the product line that the two companies have while Frutarom is contributing its strength in natural product 75% of our sales combination on solution combining taste, nutrition and health fast growth in natural health ingredient, natural color, natural antioxidant, the entrance into infant and elderly nutrition with Enzymotec, the acquisition that we did in active cosmetics ingredient where IFF is a very strong player and did several acquisitions, so Frutarom is contributing to that new product and new technology. In the last 12 years, Frutarom built a leadership global position in savory solution to the processed meat and fish and to the ready meal industry. IFF is not core in this area, so again complimentary business not overlapping business and a lot of cross-selling as I mentioned.
We are very, very excited to use -- to be able to use the excellent technology platform and science that IFF invested in over the last many years. All these technology will be available to 35,000 customers of Frutarom and I'm sure this will boost our internal growth of the combined company. When you look at geography, again very complimentary, Frutarom is very strong in Europe and mainly in Central and East Europe where IFF is not strong. IFF is much stronger than Frutarom in the United States and in Asia, and together we are creating the best and strongest sales and marketing organization in our world, both in geography and technology and product and solution and customers.
And I believe that combining the strength of IFF and Frutarom is two excellent companies with both mid-sized smaller, local customers and the multinational we are creating the best company in the industry. While adding to that the operational synergies that we are committed to achieve of above $145 million that we come primarily from harmonization and global purchasing and combining operational size to enjoy the best site that the two companies have together, I believe we are creating one plus one equal to four and not two and ultimately not 1.5. This is also the reason why Frutrom choose and build, a build structure that combine one third of the value of Frutarom in IFF in the combined company shares because we want to enjoy the value creation that this merger and integration will bring.
The deal is subject to remain I believe more technical processes. One is the approval of Antitrust Commissioner in some relevant countries since the businesses are very complementary. Personally, I don't see a real difficulty in getting the approval that will happen within the next couple of months. The second element that we need to achieve is the approval of Frutarom shareholders in a shareholders meeting that will be called following the registration of IFF shares with the U.S. SEC that we're working on together with IFF.
Again, I don't expect that this will be a burden on achieving and finalizing the deal. And I'm sure that the deal will be approval by the Frutarom shareholders with full support both of ICC as a major shareholder, myself, the management and many other investors that I speak with. In the same time, we work together with IFF to start planning the post-merger integration the PMI on all its relevant areas. And I'm sure, that together with the excellent team of IFF heading by the Chairman, Andreas Fibig, my friend with whom I am in very direct and friendly professional contact. We will build together the largest fastest growing and most profitable company in our area.
If you allow me on a personal note, I believe that we are creating with this merger a very exciting investment opportunity. I'm not talking about arbitrage or dollar-shekel or any other element that the some investors or analysts are focusing. What I suggest is to look on the total picture to combine Frutarom with its growth IFF with its growth. The operational synergies, the cross selling opportunities and look at the value of the total company. And I'm sure that you'll reach a very interesting conclusion that I reached. So, we are very excited and going into this venture and this journey with the full trust that we are making the right step, in the right direction, in the right time. I thank you for listening to me for a so long time.
And I will be very happy to answer any question you have together with my colleagues here."
Operator,1,"Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Tavy Rosner of Barclays. Please go ahead."
Tavy Rosner,1,"First, I wanted to ask you about the acquisition that you made over the past couple of years. In most cases, you always often talked about the founder as you know staying on board for at least couple of years. So I’m just wondering, the potential acquisition by IFF changes anything i.e. does it trigger any earn out as far as these managers are concerned, and more generating speaking, as you've seen they feel about being controlled by company in the size of f Frutarom and then suddenly entering into a very much larger organization?"
Ori Yehudai,1,"Thank you, Tavy for this important relevant question. I see it is part of my job in the next coming few months before the deal conclude. And I have obviously as you can imagine discussion with Frutarom partners, many of them are very happy with the acquisition and see more opportunities than they saw before with the platform of IFF. Some of them no doubt have some concern because people generally don’t like changes, but I strongly believe that together with Andreas, the Chairman of IFF, we will find the best solution and we’ll continue to work in an amicable way with those partners to the benefit of the combined company."
Tavy Rosner,1,"And then, I think last couple of quarters you talked about global purchasing power and having -- but half of your raw material being purchased with the program. Are you still on track with that? And how will the acquisition by IFF change this ratio?"
Ori Yehudai,1,"Look, we had a target of 50% that unfortunately we did not achieve because we are focusing more on so many acquisitions that we did over the last two years. Important part of the synergies that we see and more than we, IFF see, in the combination of Frutarom and IFF, is using the very, very strong purchasing power and the global purchasing organization of IFF that Frutarom didn't have, and we already working on teams that following the closer of the deal. We will work on harmonization and the deal with low-hanging fruits to achieve the best cost of raw material that will improve, and we’ll contribute very nicely the dollars that we are looking for from global purchasing. I strongly believe that this will bring a very significant value over relatively not long period following the closer of the deal something that Frutarom just started to enjoy, but together with IFF, we have much more purchasing power and more important IFF has very strong global purchasing that Frutarom didn't have."
Tavy Rosner,1,"That’s helpful. And then maybe a last one if I may. If you look at Frutarom on the standalone basis that you said that regarding the guidance for 2020, your revenue run rate is already on track and your margins are pretty much where you want them to be. So why not update their guidance, if we are still confident about the run rate and the margins and expansion?"
Ori Yehudai,1,"Tavy, my friend, we update the target three times I think over the last three years. We are in a process of implementing the merger with IFF. I believe that following the closure of the deal, the combined company under the management will put the right targets with the right strategy that I'm sure will bring the value creation that I'm expecting to achieve as a shareholder in the combined company."
Operator,1,The next question is from Brett Hundley of Vertical Group. Please go ahead.
Brett Hundley,1,"I wanted to start by asking you, it doesn't sound like Roy is going to get anytime off the airplane here anytime soon. It sounds like you guys still very much plan to pursue your acquisition pipeline up to the IFF merger and maybe through. I guess I have a multiple part question here. So number one, can you just confirm that for me? Number two, is there anything in your merger agreement with IFF that relates to your M&A strategy leading up to the merger? And then number three, how much of your $2.25 billion revenue goal is based on forward M&A.
I'm trying to get a sense of what you may have done in 2019 and 2020, if you had been a standalone company and I kind of back and there maybe a $200 million lift from potential M&A down the road, but I just wanted to get that answer from you. So just a recap number one will you still actively can continue to pursue your acquisition pipeline? Number two is there anything in the merger agreement related to that? And then number three, just what percentage of or what portion of that $2.25 billion revenue goal would have come from M&A?"
Ori Yehudai,1,"Thank you very much, Brett, first for your continued support and for the excellent questions. I'm not allowed to answer on behalf of my friend Andreas from IFF, but I can tell you that in many discussions I personally had with Andreas, part of the positive and value that he showed in Frutarom and Frutarom team is our ability to implement good acquisition combined them in an efficient way and create value out of them, and no doubt that IFF see future acquisition important part of the growth strategy as IFF was showing over that last couple of years when Andreas became the Chairman of IFF. And we do have an understanding with IFF that which is quite logic that we will discuss and agree about the future acquisition that Frutarom has in the pipeline.
But let me tell you that these discussions are taking place in a positive way, and I am sure that together, we will pick up the best acquisition, the right growth, the right valuation, and the right strategy fit to the combined company. So I feel very, very strongly about our ability to continue implement acquisition. Maybe in the mid-run it will -- the acquisition will be directed more towards strategic goal of the combined company, maybe it will be less smaller companies in certain areas where IFF is already strong so no need to buy smaller companies which was need of Frutarom. But we have so many opportunities out of 1,200 potential small mid-sized local companies out of them 200 on our shortlist. So rest assure that we are at the end the small commando team that we have, will have enough on its plate for as far as future acquisitions are concerned.
To answer your third question, we mentioned that we built our $2.250 billion based on at least minimum 5% internal growth and the rest come from acquisition i.e. around $170 million $180 million in revenue by average in every year till 2020, which something that we have done more than that over the last two to three years. So we feel comfortable with that."
Brett Hundley,1,"And then, on your last question, you guys were talking about the centralized purchasing effort that you guys had in place and the 50% number there. Is that something that I'm getting the feeling that that's something that for lack of a better phrase kind of gets put on hold so to speak until the merger? Or am I just reading that wrong and that that something that you will continue to focus on leading up to the merger?"
Ori Yehudai,1,"First, we don't put on hold anything because we are working as an independent company. And I just thank today three global contracts after work of harmonization that happened over the last six months. So, we will continue, but I'm much more excited to be connected to IFF global purchasing that I know very well also as a supplier to IFF and we supply to IFF many, many ingredients. So I know very well since I was a sales guy in Frutarom 30 years ago, how strong our IFF in purchasing and I think I know very well the IFF global head of purchasing. And I think she's excellent and has a very good team. And I think that together IFF has the infrastructure the Frutarom built and we were building. So we will leverage on the IFF global infrastructure in order to boost enhance and enlarge our global purchasing and get the benefits much sooner. "
Brett Hundley,1,"And then Ori my last question for you is on your SFI business. By no means am I trying to discount the 8% plus growth that you guys put up during the quarter. Certainly, it's a little bit below where you were trending last year, but it's still very, very solid. And as you’ve told us overtime, SFI tends to be more of a volatile business anyway relative to your core flavors business. But can you just talk a little bit about the market environment within SFI? You have a lot of attractive products there and when we think about the growth rate in that business. I guess, what I’m really trying to get out is. Do you see competition heating up in anyway? There are so many companies, they’re trying to follow you and get into certain business areas, whether its extracts or something else and really combined with other products to sell these integrated solutions to the customers. So, is that a market that you really see heating up or is it more just the volatile nature that you see time-to-time in that business?"
Ori Yehudai,1,"I’m happy, I ask you to ask this question. No, I’m joking. I agree that the fine ingredient business is a more volatile business than the flavor that is more I'd say customers are buying every month, every two months where they need. Here, you do see more volatility. But if you look at Frutarom results over the last year and half two, you can see a continuous internal growth in the last few quarters by average double-digit growth. I believe this will continue. The world is moving towards natural and Frutarom is one of the leading players in that area. We do see competition, but I think and I hate to say, I mean, it’s not my nature typically but I will say it now.
I think we are better than the competition. I think that we are better than the Company that the largest flavor company acquired recently by any mean, I truly believe that the product portfolio that we are building, the technology that we have, the projects that we build over the last two years, while increasing capacity taking that integration approach with our own seeds, patented seeds that contain much higher quantity of active ingredient. 
The acquisition of Enzymotec, IBR, biotechnology energy grow that we acquired in the United States and many, many others. Really put us in the frontend of the market as far as technology ability to build together solutions to our customers, which is one of Frutarom main strengths and that’s because we are mainly dealing with the smaller midsized customer that want to see a tailor-made solution and a full solution much more than the bigger that prefer to buy single ingredients in order not to be dependent on one supplier.
But the smaller customers really like to buy natural color and flavors than anti-oxidants together in one package and not to work with too many supplies, which make the life more complicated. I really believe that here you see also in the first quarter that even the margin of the fine ingredient. This first time in our history hire than the margin in our flavor business. So, we are very, very excited and very pleased with the growth in the fine ingredient, additional acquisition in the pipeline. I think that IFF sees the same value in Frutarom and in the combined company."
Operator,1,Your next question is from Fintan Ryan of Berenberg Bank. Please go ahead.
Fintan Ryan,1,"Few questions for me please. Firstly I’m wondering, if you can please reconcile and the run rate sales that you've given in the presentation at over $1.5 billion with the figures given in the IFF presentation for the acquisition. So for 2018 they are saying sales of the both $1.6 billion and the core EBITDA margin of 22%, wondering could you just confirm those figures that are still relevant and why you are tracking for this year?"
Ori Yehudai,1,You want me to answer right about one by one or you want to give me on the greater as you like.
Fintan Ryan,1,"I'll continue with questions. Then when it comes to the synergies and that's the deal and so you run through the 9% of your run rate sales about $145 million. Wondering is there a sense that you that Frutarom on a standalone basis is probably leaving some of those costs on the table and now like the mid-term margin targets on these were 23%? And that are like, are there some of those synergies which like Frutarom on a standalone basis given its current scale could help to achieve rather than requiring IFF in essence to get these sense or just kind of these given that they are the visibility on these synergies seems quite secure? Then finally, could you confirm us that since the deal announcement that you haven't seen any sort of changes internally within the Frutarom organization like sales people or R&D people looking to leave the organization and you are still confident of sort of similar sales momentum going through the rest of the year?"
Ori Yehudai,1,"First of all the 1.6 is a number I feel very comfortable with I mentioned that the run rate for 2017 on a pro forma basis is 1.5 billion related to that internal growth and some acquisition that we are not a part of 2017 and you reach a number that these are above 1.6 billion off course our budget is much higher than that so I feel very comfortable with 1.6, 22% EBITDA in our core business I believe is more than achievable I want to achieve higher number in the second half of the year and you can see that in the first quarter that is typically the weakest both in favorable margin. We are achieving over 22% in our core business, so I fully support the IFF statement here.
And your second question is much tougher for me. I mean I was leaving something on the table the answer is definitely, yes. Frutarom did I think 71 acquisitions over the years in many cases we shared synergies in many cases we took all the synergies I think the beauty of these deal is that we maintained significant shareholders in the combined company and we want to achieve a part of the synergy through being shareholder of the new IFF, which is a merger between the two excellent company Frutarom and IFF. I believe that the culture fit the product customers that are very compliment. The cross-selling opportunity will bring us more value than what we leave on the table. So I'm happy to leave something on the table which I think is sensible to do.
On your first question, I'm happy to say that I'm not aware of any person, that decide to leave Frutarom or I am aware that is about or want to leave Frutarom. I can tell you that I spent significant amount of my time together with our management to talk to the people. IFF management already met quite a lot of the key people of Frutarom. I think the next few months, even though we have the limitations the legal, I would say restriction. But as far as people we can and we will have discussion about the potential PMI post-merger integration, new roles in the combined company.
And I feel comfortable and I'm sure that IFF would love to have the excellent people that Frutarom have that allow us to achieve the results that we are showing in the last couple of years. We do have retention programs and other programs that ensure continuation of the business momentum for business. And personally for me, it's 34 years that I'm with Frutarom. It's very important for me to see that our key employees and excellent partners will continue to enjoy the future growth of the combined company."
Operator,1,The next question is from Andrew Stott of UBS. Please go ahead.
Andrew Stott,1,"Let's start with one for you Ori. I read in the original statements that you planned to stay on as a special advisor. I just wondered if you had signed a contract on a duration attached to that special advisor status. Ori, just going to agree upon means to be convenient day if you go. So just interested on how long you're going to stay within the pro forma most organization? And second question would be on M&A. It's sort of going back to what's already been asked, but I'm asking in a slightly different way. If you found only 200 short list story that you mentioned earlier. If you found an acquisition that was in adjacent area rather than flavors, would you have a 100% free range to do that deal before the deal closes with IFF? So if you saw another Enzymotec as an example, would you be able to do that deal? And then the final one is really specific on cash flow. The one I guess slightly negative out of the quarter was the cash flow on my numbers down 28% pre-M&A. I just wondered what one-offs there in Q1 either in CapEx, cash tax or working capital which seems to be the three contributing factors?"
Ori Yehudai,1,"Thank you very, very much again for your continued support and your understanding of the Frutarom business and strategy. Let me start with your last question. I am slightly less happy about the cash flow, but the main contributor the cash flow where commercial decision that I was important part of to buy some strategic inventory of some natural product that the price went up by 10s of percentage, and we bought quite significant inventory to cover one year plus till the new crop will come. And we have contracts to cover for most of these products with the good margin. So this was the commercial decision to increase inventory on some very key natural raw material that will see the benefit from as of the second quarter this year.
And I’m sure that is of the second quarter, you will see the improvement in cash flow as we have been able to show over the last couple of years. So I’m slightly less happy, but I know exactly where it is and this was strategically a decision that we took because I prefer profit than giving some explanation about cash flow, and it’s my job to show you that this trend will improve in the coming quarter. As far as your second question, look we have an understanding with IFF that on top of certain acquisitions that where agreed upon before end. We will have a discussion with IFF about implementing new adjacent like Enzymotec, but I am sure that any good acquisition that will bring to the table, we will do because it makes a lot of sense and it creates value.
And again, this was part of the main reason I believe for IFF to do the deal. I think the Frutarom deal and expertise of doing very efficient effective acquisitions and create value out of them. And from my time spent with Andreas Fibig, the Chairman of IFF, over the last 10 months or so, I can tell you that I don’t expect that I come with something that makes a lot of sense. And Andreas will say, let’s now do it because of whatever.
So, I feel very comfortable that we will be able to continue our growth strategy including through M&A. The first question you have look I’ve never been a consultant, but I am 100% committed to Frutarom and to the successful of this merger and integration. It’s really not about any recent document. It’s about my personal commitment to my third baby. I have 2 daughters. This is my third one. I am 100% committed to the success of this merger to be a shareholder of the new IFF with the composition of Frutarom. The same see by the way, Dr. John Farber in ICC as major shareholder of Frutarom. And I am sure and let me correct myself, I’m sure and I hope that IFF will see the value of having the support in the area, where I believe, I can bring the value to the combined company."
Operator,1,"[Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Yehudai, would you like to make your concluding statement?"
Ori Yehudai,1,"Yes, please. So, thank you very much for participating in this call more than that thank you very much for your continued support and interest in small Frutarom, but became slightly bigger and will become part of IFF as the biggest company in our industry. Roy, my friend, Alon my friend, and colleague, and myself are at your disposal for any questions you might have. As you can see, we are very excited both about the results of Frutarom as standalone in 2018 and going forward and even more excited about the opportunity that the merger is brining. So, thank you very much and have a great afternoon and day."
Operator,1,"Thank you. This concludes the Frutarom Industries Ltd., First Quarter 2018 Results Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You may go ahead and disconnect."
