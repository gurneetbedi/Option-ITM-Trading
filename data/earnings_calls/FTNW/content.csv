Michael Palleschi,0,"Thank you, Mike, and thank you all for joining today. We had a fantastic quarter. Revenues have increased quarter-over-quarter in line with our 350 million in guidance for 2018 and EBITDA growth is on track. We have 21 contracted building at CrossLayer and that seven more that we've brought on since our most recent public announcement. We will have more than 500 million in new infrastructure contracts by yearend.
Before I highlight our impressive growth and achievements from the tremendous opportunities within our sites, I want each of you to know that I'm keenly aware that our progress should be measured by our sales, our profitability, our innovation and also our share price. I'm deeply aware that our stock price is an important measure of the progress that we will make in weeks, months and years to come.
The catalyst for this progress will be continued growth of our business and also the advancement and revenue and profit recognition from CrossLayer, our technology segment. We are planning a number of strategic initiatives that will allow us to recognize an increasing larger percentage of our revenues in CrossLayer.
As many of you are aware, we have been reinvesting our profits into CrossLayer, a confident debt on our future which we plan on demonstrating during at Investor Day at our corporate headquarters here at Naples, Florida, in which our technology that we believe will commit a significantly higher valuation for our company in 2009 given the momentum that we see continuing in the fourth quarter and beyond.
During this quarter, several of our growth initiatives gained significant traction, both internally and with strategic partners, and we are anticipating an even stronger fourth quarter. It is an undoubtedly the most exciting time in our history as CrossLayer adoption rates are accelerating and our infrastructure segment continues to fire on all cylinders.
Before we dive into third quarter review, I would like to take a moment to revisit the vision we had when forming this company and how that relates to where we are today. A few years back we became convinced that a trend was developing known as edge computing, which will drive most of the significant change to our network infrastructures in the industry and seen in the last two decades.
In the past, relatively low number of data centers in major metropolitan cities delivered content to end users phones, tablets or desktops and the geographic distance between that user and the data was often significant. This created inherent problem because the greater the distance between the two, the greater the latency or the time it takes to send and receive data.
Relentless pressure has been placed upon traditional networks to deliver ever-increasing amount of data to devices while the complexity of applications use regularly have increased at an unprecedented rate. It was inevitable that data centers would need to be located geographically closer to the end user to satisfy the elevated flow of data. As we nurture our CrossLayer product from concept product to prototype commercialization, we became increasingly convinced that we can effectively locate a micro data center on-site in a cost-effective carrier agnostic way that will provide significant benefits to the property owner and tenants.
While comparing CrossLayer with major carriers offerings quite simply, we outperformed in every important facet. We’re superior to our competition and pricing as well as the speed in which we can deliver a complete data center on-site with a smaller physical footprint than our competitors. Frankly, we’re best-in-class provider and there’s an enormous addressable market and we’re aggressively capturing market share with 21 times [indiscernible] building since our January 2018 launch and many more expected in the fourth quarter.
CrossLayer offers advanced network speeds with additional features functionality and reliability all at a lower cost in the competition. CrossLayer customers began to recognize value immediately which compares to a 30-to 60-day lead time from traditional providers. This is a huge component of the credibility we are rapidly establishing in the marketplace. We can turn up customers' real time, upon moving, supporting landlord's ability to secure tenant contracts.
Turning to edge computing according to a study from IDC Research Group, 45% of all data created by IoT devices will be stored, processed, analyzed and acted upon close to or at the edge of the network by 2020. The market opportunity is simply massive and the current surge in CrossLayer contract activity reflects that reality.
As we are bringing on new buildings on-net mean that we can sell our services to tenants with the new buildings, we’re getting consistent reports from property owners confirming their ability to realize higher rates per square foot as a result of the appeal that CrossLayer with respect to the tenants. This is not surprising as businesses are increasingly ranking network functionality and reliability as critical factors in the decision-making.
By offering turnkey network accessibility, owners who reduce lead times to tenancy and therefore higher occupancy rates. When coupled with resulting higher rent rates per square foot, this is a very powerful combination that is extremely appealing to building owners. Building infrastructures have largely remained static for years, but that is no longer the case. Tenants are now seeking advanced network capabilities and intelligent building functionality. And property owners are viewing CrossLayer as a cornerstone in that service offering.
We’re taking an increasing leadership role in this hot growth area and our infrastructure business, which I’ll address shortly, has a lot of to hit the ground running. The vast majority of our recent CrossLayer implementations are with building owners that have large property portfolios. With these enthusiastic owners recognizing the positive impact of our technology on their property economic performance, the return on investment this should equate to additional CrossLayer contract wins spending entire property portfolios in the very near future.
We’re experiencing a surge in recent contract activity associated with CrossLayer, and we expect this growth to expand even further in the near term. As previously announced, we had 14 building currently on-net and I am also very proud to announce that first time that we’ve contracted with seven additional buildings that are currently in the implementation phase. We are also in late stages of negotiation with respect to significant number of additional contracts, which we expect to close in the coming weeks many in the fourth quarter.
We expanded our CrossLayer footprint this quarter, entering a new major metropolitan market including Chicago and Arizona with a global real estate development company. We also entered into a partnership with a large Canadian construction company where we’re finalizing contracts with various desirable properties. We have invested significant resources to educate our partners, sales team and as a result our business pipelines are growing at an unprecedented rate.
The expansion of our CrossLayer sales team and partnerships will yield ever increasing long-term recurring revenue streams that are very sticky and tenants become accustom and dependent to CrossLayers technology, which allows them to remain consistent with their multiple buildings across corporate campuses. We expect to introduce CrossLayer as a multiple additional major metropolitan markets by yearend.
Our infrastructure segment highlight includes strong top line growth and the pace of new contract wins is robust and growing month over month. We expect to end 2018 with more than $500 million in new contract wins, which is exceptional by any measure. We have established a strong brand and we will recognize for delivering the highest quality work product on time and on budget. While we recognize that shareholders have expressed concern over our debt, we retired $7.5 million in aggregate debt last month alone.
An additional debt is not coming due until March and April of 2019. Although debt has increased on a short-term basis, the shared volume of new projects this quarter involved additional upfront cost which we determined that non-dilutive debt financial would be less costly than capital market alternatives. Our CFO, David Lethem, will expand more on these points in the financial section, but with strong demand, the near-term increase in cost is largely a function of our ex financial growth.
Over the lifetime of these contracts, we expect margins to be consistent with traditional levels. We have a strong mix of reoccurring work with existing long-term Fortune 100 customers and we can seek to regularly add new high-profile clients. The financial business communities are taking note of our rapid growth.
Last week, we received recognition and congratulations from New York Stock Exchange as Deloitte named us the 95th fastest growing company in North America with a 1,388% year-over-year growth as a 2018 Technology Fast 500 Winner. The Technology Fast 500 is a leading technology awards program combining technological innovation, entrepreneurship and rapid growth.
Now, I'll go ahead and hand it over to CFO, David Lethem, who will cover the financial results. David, please go ahead."
David Lethem,0,"Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon everyone. I will now provide you with the summary of our financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2018. For more detailed results, please refer to the Company’s earnings release which was sent out this morning along with [Audio Gap] Securities and Exchange Commission.
Our revenue for the three month ended September 30, 2018 were $92.2 million as compared to revenues of 79.1 million for the three-month ended the September 30, 2017, which is an increase of 13.1 million or 17%. Also during the third quarter of 2017, Benchmark began to build up its backlog after completing some large projects during the first half of 2017 and as continued to increase its backlog through the third quarter of 2018.
For the three-month ended September 30, 2018, our gross profit was $15.9 million as compared to $15.5 million for the three-month ended September 30, 2017, an increase of 0.4 million or 2%. For the three months ended September 30, 2018, our gross profit margin did decrease a little bit by about 1% from 20% to 19%, compared with the three months ended the September 30, 2017, primarily due to the change in product mix, timing and schedule, project cost and start up costs associated with starting new contract.
Total operating expenses for the third quarter of 2018 were 19.3 million compared to operating expenses of 10.7 million in the third quarter of 2017, representing an increase of about 8.6 million or about 80%. The increase in operating expenses year-over-year is primarily attributed to the continued investment in growth in the technology segment, leading to higher compensation SG&A expenses reserve for other assets and acquisitions costs.
Operating loss was approximately 3.4 million in the third quarter of 2018, which included approximately 5.6 million in one-time expenses, compared to the prior-year quarter pro forma operating income of 4.8 million which included approximately 1.5 million in one-time expenses. Other expense for the third quarter of 2018 totaled $8.4 million compared to 1.3 million in the third quarter 2017, representing an increase of 7 million or about 546%.
The increase is primarily attributable to the amortization expense of deferred financing costs debt discounts. There was a significant decrease in the change in warrant fair valuation of about $2 million due to the adoption of accounting rates which no longer exist. Financing cost of 1,3 million and about 0.6 million in settlement expenses related to certain contractual obligations and we had also had a slightly increase in interest expense of about 3. -- excuse me 0.3 million.
To reiterate our increase in expenses is related to the exponential growth we’ve experienced over the past 12 months, and our stated goal of cleaning up the balance sheet. We remain intensely focused on managing our operating expenses, [indiscernible] expenditures are necessary to support our growth. On a GAAP basis, net loss was approximately $12 million or $1.89 share for three months ended September 30, 2018.
For the three months ended September 30, 2017, we had net income of $2.5 million most of that was driven by the valuation allowances for $0.47 share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was approximately $0.3 million or $0.04 per share for the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to a gain of 7.5 million, or 1.36 -- excuse me $1.36 per share during the same period in 2017.
Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2018 was approximately $7.8 million, compared to $8.9 million for the prior period. Our primary source of liquidity have been cash provided by operations, the strategic use of debt, our principal uses of cash have been for working capital, capital expenditures and debt service requirements. Along this, we anticipate our principal uses of cash in the future will be for debt service working capital, capital expenditures and potential acquisitions.
As of September 30, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $5.7 million, which is a decrease of 7.2 million from June 30, 2018. However, on a comparative basis, our trade accounts receivable closed at $75 million at the end of September 30, 2018. Our working capital deficit was 41 million, which is primarily due to the reclassification of our senior debt. As of September 30, 2018, we had a backlog of unfulfilled contracts and master service agreements of approximately $474 million, which includes $285 million of Benchmark’s backlog.
We believe with our current revenues of 263.7 million in backlog and orders under master services agreement of approximately again $474 million as of September 30, 2018. Our sources of cash would be sufficient to contain operation and working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. This concludes my prepared financial commentary.
Operator, please proceed with the question-and-answer portion of the call."
Operator,1,[Operator Instructions] Our first question will be coming from the line of Malcolm Mcguire with Malcolm Mcguire Associates. Please proceed with your question.
Malcolm Mcguire,1,"Michael and David, we appreciate very much sharing what looks like very strong performance for this last quarter. I think the thing that’s on the mind of a lot of people is that, the performance looks very good and the stock obviously has not performed well. And I think the question in a lot of people's minds is what are we missing here? Why are the dots not being connected? A second question and just to have both of those out is, with significant revenues and the explanation David that you have given. Can you maybe give a little bit more explanation to the reported loss? So, it actually would be one question for Michael and one for David. And what are we missing here in terms of the stock prices as compared to the performance? And David just maybe a little bit more explanation on the accounting losses that we are taking them? And how long this goes into the future?"
Michael Palleschi,1,"Thank you, Malcolm. Thank you for your time, thank you for joining. So I'll address the first part of that question regarding stock price. It's just painful to our shareholders as it is to me. Quite frankly, the overall market conditions have been deteriorating this year with the major indexes giving up all their gains for [2008] and most recent days, I think it was actually announced this morning that all of the 2018 gains were lost. So, one thing is the market, but that said [indiscernible] path and we believe investors will recognize the opportunity that we are now creating at a significant discount to book value. We believe that there is a misconception with regard to the understanding of our financials given that we are investing heavily in our technology, which is CrossLayer, and we believe it will be one of the key growth drivers for 2019.
With that, I'll turn it over to David to explain more about the losses you have mentioned."
David Lethem,1,"Yes, first I'll address that significant revenue portion. Malcolm, you know that quarter-over-quarter we have shown gains in our top line revenue. Third quarter was not a record for FTE, if everybody remembers fourth quarter of 2017 was a record, I think we had about $110 million of top line revenue. So, we are closed but maybe fourth quarter we will see what happens then. As we have talked about before and I have explained you to another calls and the people that I talk to on the phone, it's kind of difficult to way through some of these things that we do upon a quarterly basis.
And I think from a top level approach, people have to remember that when we required Benchmark Builders back in April 2017, there was a significant amount of intangible assets that we’re required to book according to GAAP in order to complete the booking of that acquisition, which we did from an accounting perspective as of 12/31/17. Those assets have definitive lives, some are three years, some are four years, some are two years, and every quarter we’ve to recognize an expense depending on what line item it is. Some goes to COGS because some of the intangibles were associated with the generation of revenues. Some goes to SG&A because some of those intangibles are required to be recorded in the SG&A, and some goes to global lines.
We’ll continue for example every quarter as I said, we recognize 1.3 million in our cost of goods sold, every quarter until the tangible asset is off the book sometime I believe in 2020. We do have about $1 million in intangibles in SG&A, and the reconciliation table, that we do every quarter, provide to investors, we want to paint the clearest picture we can to the investors on what’s the true health of this company. And if we back out interest expense which I am happy to say if you look quarter-to-quarter it’s gone down due to the efforts of cleaning up the balance sheet.
You add back the amortization depreciation and the other LIBOR we have EBITDA, again 7.8 million which I think very consistently first quarter and second quarter, we have been around 7.3, 7.5 in EBITDA we’re at 7.8 which makes sense because revenue is higher this quarter than it was last quarter. So I think if the Company -- if the investors kind of understood and took that picture back with them, they would actually see operating income for the Company which I think would change the way that some people view the Company and how we do on a quarter-by-quarter basis."
Michael Palleschi,1,"Malcolm, I’ll say one thing as well. Into 2019, we believe CrossLayer will have a significant impact on our P&L, and we are actually going to take the appropriate steps to segment, both technology and infrastructure, so that a very clear representation of each segment will be visible to individual shareholders starting in 2019. At that point, we believe, it’ll be material enough to make that change, and we’ve made investment we’ve worked hard to get it to where it’s at, and it’s time to report it as such."
Operator,1,Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Sacks with RHK Capital. Please proceed with your question.
Gary Sacks,1,Can you please address the share issuance for the past six to nine months? It seems like there’s been a lot more supply coming into the market. Will that be ending soon?
Michael Palleschi,1,"Yes, I think you’re referring to the additional issuances that were done after September 30th, we do issue and we’ve issued is reported in Q1, Q2, and reported Q3 that for a variety of contractual obligations. We have issued shares and that is actually decreased from Q1 to Q2 to Q3, so we’ve been very cognizant of the impact of issuing those no shares. Now those shares just so we’re clear, those shares are restricted shares. So, there’s just typically 6 months, sometimes 12 months waiting period that’s required by the SEC, before those shares are allowed to go to the market. So since we’ve been issuing these in -- since the first quarter 2018, I can tell you that those there are not a significant amount of those shares in relation that actually are going to market simply because they are still restricted.
Now referring to the shares that were issued after the 9/30 quarter, need to understand that, we are approaching the yearend, and as we have about 400 or so employees, this is the yearend time where everybody gets benefit of the assessment kind of a state of the health of the Company. And quite frankly, we believe that the Company has performed, met or exceeded expectations. We came out in January we said we do $350 million a year. We are on target to do that. We said, we will do 30 million in EBITDA. We are on target to do that. We'd come out with 30 million -- excuse me, 30 buildings on-net, and we are on target to meet or achieve that goal.
So, for a company to issue shares especially like we kind of designate CrossLayers can stood as the startup company. The stable little cost and salary expense, you compensate that with the ability to the issued shares. And A, they benefit in the long term, and the Company benefits in the long-term because they have long-term incentivized employee.
Also at yearend, we did some chewing up, but we are again for some directors, officers, employees that we are contractually obligated through the employment contracts and appointment agreements that we have to recruit our employees and we have to tell them that, we did and what we are going to do and that’s what we did. We view our employees as our most valuable asset as we grow, and we ask them to do monumental things this year. We are going to ask them to do just as much and more in 2019 and 2020. So, we want them incented, we want them to stay with the Company, and this is one of the vehicles that we are utilizing to do so."
Operator,1,Our next question is from the line of Suji Desilva with ROTH Capital. Please proceed with your question.
Suji Desilva,1,"So, David, you gave a backlog total number and you gave I think a Benchmark number. Can you give us those metrics again? And what was the non Benchmark backlog where that’s coming from?"
David Lethem,1,You want to breakdown of the Benchmark numbers.
Suji Desilva,1,"Yes, I think you gave a backlog number total David and then a Benchmark backlog number."
David Lethem,1,"Yes, 284 million was Benchmark and 190 million was FTE Networks in its master services agreement. I think the total is about 474 or so."
Suji Desilva,1,"And then, Michael, perhaps on the CrossLayer buildings on-net, at point I think today you've kind of gotten one building at a time, I'm presuming. And as some of these partners kick in and you get some of these partners helping out, is it possible you'd get multiple building coming out of once? And if so, what's the size of that potential add versus the one-offs you have been getting today?"
Michael Palleschi,1,"So, great question and why do ask that because we haven’t been announcing it as such, and we will be here shortly after the holiday week, we will be coming out with some new wins. But the recent wins in New York, just to give you some color, one of the property building owners own 20 properties and we are actively installing in about half a dozen a little. Another one owns 60 properties and right now I can't announce how many of that we have signed but we have the full visibility of that 60, it’s just a process of doing surveys and turning them and getting the approvals. But we’re going after large owners since you’ve multiple and actually multiple bites at the apple with them."
Suji Desilva,1,"And are the metrics still supporting the 400,000 for building annual opportunity as you kind of flush out the CrossLayer model?"
Michael Palleschi,1,"Yes, as long as we can get to a saturation point 60% or better, and we think that’s a six to nine month term from the time that we actually get the building on-net. And what we’re seeing right now is nothing much of a deviation from that, but hopefully as we separate our financial into segment reporting in 2019, you could see that more clearly and have a better picture as to what CrossLayer itself on a standalone basis looks like."
Suji Desilva,1,"And then lastly maybe for David, the OpEx and CapEx, can you give us a sense of what the expected trend going forward is here? I know you’re investing in some of the opportunities it’d be good to do kind of how those numbers trend into 2019?"
David Lethem,1,"I mean the OpEx on an adjusted basis going forward, I think we’ve pretty much got CrossLayer handle for the time being, we did see an increase in employee headcount in the first and second quarter for CrossLayer. You’re going to see that not accelerate actually you’ll see that kind of level off and be more normalized. The CapEx is going to be off of CrossLayer. Benchmark and Jus-Com while they both have upfront costs, when they start a new project, there’s enough cash on hand, they’re capitalized sufficiently to handle that.
CrossLayer again like, we said we invested about $10 million in 2017, through the nine months ended September 30th, we’ve invested just a little over $6 million in CrossLayer, and that includes engineers and programmers that are working on some significant enhancements to CrossLayer, in order to be able to deploy that, in a variety of different uses, MD use, smaller building, campuses etc., that we’re exploring now.
So, OpEx, you’ll see start to level off. We do have a couple increases this quarter that were one offs, that were related to the acquisition and reserve for some other assets that we’ve had on the books for a couple of years. One-time reserves that will take the hit this quarter and when we collect or realize the asset then it’ll be a pickup on the gain.
So, you saw some of those anomalies in Q3, but that’s we expected since we announced for the year 2018. We’re on the mission to clean up the balance sheet, so that’s what we’re doing and these things are going to happen, but I think we have pretty much got cleaned up for this year so shouldn’t seeing anything that extraordinary going forward."
Suji Desilva,1,Thank you.
David Lethem,1,"So operator, I don’t normally do this, but I'd text the question and I think it’s very-very-very important to inform the shareholders of this question. So I am going to ask it and direct the answer to David, so regarding our debt in Q3 that was recorded, the question was. Why has it increased? So why did the overall debt increased in this quarter? So I am going to turn it over to David and have him explained so that because I believe it’s very important for our shareholders to understand, why the financial statements say, it's X and why we believe, it's Y. So, David, go ahead please?"
David Lethem,1,"Sure, I mean there is two thresholds to take a look at. One is there is two major components of the majority of our debt that’s the senior debt, that’s approximately I think in net book value about $29 million $30 million, and then the selling notes since we paid of the $7.5 million to our C note is down to about $42.5 million. And again, the senior debt as people know, they were with us way before the acquisition, they came on with the companies, supported us through the acquisition and continues some more through today.
We took on the $50 million of selling notes which people say, wow, that’s a pretty large number. But look, those rates are about 3% to 4%, and if you look at taking on a seller note for $50 million and the acquisition involves stock and some cash too, But if what I have got left is $50 million is generating $300 million plus in revenue a year at 18%, 20%, 22% gross margin, not a bad investment, not really terrible debt to have on the book. So if you look at it too, the senior note is a little more expensive. Again, it was a riskier deal pre-acquisition so was priced appropriately when it was given to it at the time.
But if you combine the senior debt with the debt on the seller note, you got about a combined interest rate of about 9% overall. So again, this is such a dynamic company that if you tend to focus on one number and one point in time, you are really going to lose side of the big picture. And we've cautioned investors not to do that and in fact work with them quite a bit over these past several months, to explain everything that’s going on. So, back to the micro part of the debt, as we do have debt on the books, we have had debt for the last one year.
We are heck of a lot healthier company than we were two to three years ago. And we have opportunities to take your equipment leases, truck loans, any old debt, if we are able to establish a new relationship and payoff 20% car level or truck level for an 8% truck loan, we will do that. And if you can see that one of the positive results of that look from Q2 to Q3 you will see our interest expenses actually gone down, so while the debt stayed up down, up down, up down from point in time to point in time the result in interest expense you have seen a decrease in that.
So that’s the impact people and people are worried about the debt and great question asked about the debt. But you got to understand what that component again is doing and that’s helping reduce the interest expense and continue to the accretive growth of CrossLayer, Jus-Com and Benchmark."
Michael Palleschi,1,"One thing, I would like to say about our senior lenders. So for new investors that are here, that are looking at our financial statements, they are looking it as wow, that’s really expensive debt, what the heck you guys are thinking. Well, let me take it back to 2015, we signed a fund that invested in the management team those folks that are here today on this call and in the field around the country building our company. And they said, hey, we will take a chance on you and we will take a chance on your vision, and that vision has come to fruition, that’s the vision that we are living today and that we are going to tomorrow.
So, they invested $8 million in a company that was doing $12 million of revenue. So very, very, very risky and it wasn’t going to come cheap. Now, the lender borrower relationship isn’t always the best, but they believe in the Company and they’ve been a true partner to us. When we had the Benchmark acquisition, they doubled down, they brought in more capital. When we have interest payment and we look at growing CrossLayer or doing something different with the cash we’ve on hand, they’re very favorable to the Company they’re good partners. And I’ll say, well, let’s just roll out interest payment, use of cash, it makes more sense.
So as far as a lender, they’ve been a very good partner since the deal commenced in October of 2015, and they’ve grown with us. Again, they invested in the management team and our vision, and that’s the vision that we’re living today, that’s CrossLayer, that’s Benchmark, that’s Jus-Com, the three subsidiaries that we’ve, and that’s what we’re executing on. So people that have just gone into the deal, look at it and say, wow, that's really expensive, but there’s the history there and there’s a story behind it, and we couldn’t be happier. We’ve a very favorable lender and they believe in the growth of this company, and we’ll continue to execute with their support. David, do you have anything else on the debt?"
Suji Desilva,1,"I just want to point out too and again, if you look at it from a point in time, you’re not going to get the true picture. But if people take a look at what’s happened to changing debt through 9/30, we have basically reduced payments -- excuse me, reduced debt by about $3.3 million through 9/30. And keep in mind, we also paid off I think it was about 4.6 million, $4.8 million in the remainder of the Series C seller notes. So through 9/30, we have had a net debt reduction of about $3.2 million plus at the end of October, we paid off some more debt of $4.8 million.
So again, don’t just look at those up and down and up and down from one point in time, take a look at what we’re doing with our cash, what the utilization and cooperation and with moving in lender, what we’re doing with that, and how it'd impact the balance sheet, how it'd impact the P&L. And you’ll see all positive results in our belief."
Operator,1,"Thank you. At this time, we’ve reached the end of our line of time for question-and-answers. I’ll hand the floor back to Mr. Palleschi for closing remarks."
Michael Palleschi,1,"Thank you, operator. So first, I want to say I am very excited with where we’re going in 2019. I understand it’s a very frustrating time for shareholders, it's a very frustrating time for us as well, as we’re all brought into this, and we all believe in the story, but we’re very excited on where CrossLayer is going, we’re very excited where Benchmark is going, and there’re some fantastic opportunities ahead of us. We continue to execute on those opportunities.
In my opinion, we're in a very great position. Our pipelines in each respective segment are the strongest in our history, while quarterly and annual reports and future updates will quantify our success, I am going to take measured -- measurement daily, so that we can anticipate areas of challenges should they arise and mobilize our business units and teams to take clear and decisive actions that will deliver results for our company and for you, our shareholders.
We’ve laid the foundation for a great finish of 2018 and a strong start to 2019, which will be a monumental year for CrossLayer, Benchmark and Jus-Com, during at which we expect continued growth of our infrastructure businesses and our technology. I want to thank you all for your support for joining us on this evolution, for taking your time out of your day to be on this call with us, and we look forward to speaking with you soon."
Operator,1,Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today’s call. You may now disconnect.
