Operator,0,"Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Finisar Corporation Announcing Fourth Quarter Results Conference Call. Just a quick reminder today's call is being recorded.
And now at this time, I'll turn the call over to Michael Hurlston CEO."
Kurt Adzema,0,"Actually this is Kurt Adzema, CFO. Thank you, Jesse and good afternoon everyone.
I need to remind you that any forward-looking statements in today's discussion are subject to risks and uncertainties which are discussed at length in our annual and quarterly SEC filings. Actual events and results can differ materially from any forward-looking statements.
In addition the company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking information presented unless otherwise indicated all results discussed are non-GAAP basis. A complete reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results may be found in our earnings press release and in our Investor Relations section of our Web site."
"In addition, we have prepared some slides for today's call that can be found on the Investor Relations page of our Web site.",0,"Moving to our fourth quarter results, overall revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter was $310.1 million compared to $332.4 million in the third quarter. Sales of datacom products decreased by $18.1 million or 6.8% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018 to $248 million, primarily due to the expected decline in revenues from our VCSEL laser arrays for 3D sensing applications.
Sales of telecom products decreased by $4.2 million or 6.4% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018 to $62.1 million primarily due to the full three month impact of the annual telecom price reductions. In the fourth quarter, we had two 10% or greater customers.
Our top 10 customers represented 61.1% of total revenues compared to 63.3% in the prior quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 24.7% compared to 28.6% in the third quarter primarily due to the impact of the full three months of the telecom price reductions under absorption of fixed manufacturing expenses in our Allen, Texas VCSEL laser fab and an increase in non-cash inventory reserves.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $72 million compared to $72.4 million in the third quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.6 million or 1.5% of revenue compared to $22.7 million or 6.8% of revenue in the third quarter primarily due to lower revenue and lower gross margins.
Interest and other income was $3.9 million in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $5.8 million or $0.05 per diluted share compared to $22.8 million or $0.20 per diluted share in the third quarter primarily due to lower revenues and lower gross margins.
Non-GAAP taxes for the fourth quarter were approximately $2.7 million a decrease of $0.3 million compared to the third quarter. Non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal 2019 is estimated at 11% to 13%. Average diluted shares for the fourth quarter for non-GAAP purposes were totaled 116 million. Average diluted shares are expected to be approximately 116.8 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2019.
Capital expenditures were approximately $55.2 million in the fourth quarter of which 4.4 million related to the construction of the third building of our Wuxi, China manufacturing site and approximately $27 million related to the uplift of our building in Sherman, Texas and the initial deliveries of capital equipment for that site.
Construction continues on the third building of our Wuxi, China manufacturing site. We expect the construction of this building will be completed in the second half of calendar 2018.
Capital expenditures other than for Sherman, Texas for the first fiscal quarter are estimated to be approximately $30 million, which includes approximately $5 million related to the construction and fit out of the third building of the Wuxi, China manufacturing site.
In addition for Sherman, Texas for the uplift of the building and additional equipment, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $100 million in the first quarter. We excluded from our non-GAAP results a number of charges or benefits that were either non-cash or outside of core ongoing operating results. These totaled $24.1 million last quarter. If you included all these items as required under GAAP, we generated a net loss of $18.3 million or $0.16 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $55.7 million or $0.49 per diluted share in the third quarter.
That concludes my comments and I'll turn it over to Michael."
Michael Hurlston,0,"Thanks Kurt.
We expect revenues for our first fiscal quarter of 2019 to be in the range of $305 million to $325 million. We expect first quarter non-GAAP gross margins to be approximately 26% to 27%. Non-GAAP operating margins are expected to be approximately 4% to 5%. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share are expected to be in the range of $0.10 to $0.16 per share.
While our fourth quarter financial performance was disappointing, I'm encouraged by our outlook for revenue growth and improved gross margins in the first fiscal quarter. We expect to see an increase in demand for our VCSEL laser arrays for 3D sensing applications in the second fiscal quarter in connection with the expected timing of new product introductions by our customers.
In addition, we have closed a number of design wins for our VCSELs in consumer and automotive applications. Our opportunity funnel continues to increase in areas beyond automotive and handsets. We continue to make progress with respect to uplift of the building and the ordering and receipt of capital equipment for our VCSEL laser fab in Sherman, Texas for 3D sensing applications and still expect to be qualified and in production using 6-inch wafers by the end of the calendar year, which we expect to significantly increase our production capacity.
In our core business, we're seeing increased demand for ROADMs as India and China deploy more advanced networks. In our datacom transceiver business, we're seeing increased unit volumes in the data center market, but this is being offset by continued AST [ph] pressure. We have a set of cost reductions in process to provide greater pricing flexibility.
On the horizon, we believe we are well positioned with the major 5G wireless OEMs on 25-gig and 100- gig data rates for both short and long reach applications. We also believe we're well positioned for the 400 G transition starting in calendar year 2019.
Finally, I spent the last few months understanding the details of our products and opportunities. Given what I see on the horizon, I believe we can ultimately get to a sustainable operating margin of 12% to 15%. We plan to do this by ramping in new markets, changing our product mix, and focusing R&D priorities. Fundamental to achieving this objective will be managing our operating expenses to 18% to 20% of revenue. These changes will not happen overnight and will take multiple quarters to implement, but we have already begun taking steps to execute to a plan consistent with these objectives.
With this, I'm going to turn it back over to Jesse and open it up for questions. Jesse?"
Operator,1,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham. Your line is open.
Alex Henderson,1,"Great. Well, just a couple of housekeeping stuff, I could start off with. Could you just give us a sense of what the ROADMs did quarter-to-quarter in the just reported quarter, and what you think it might look like going sequentially into the upcoming quarter? Is that growth going to accelerate?"
Kurt Adzema,1,"Yes. I'd say ROADM or WSS was relatively flat in the quarter we just finished, but as Michael mentioned, we're seeing increased demand for deployments in China and India and that will drive meaningful growth in our fiscal Q1."
Alex Henderson,1,"Thank you. Going back to the datacom comment, I get the impression that you are implying that volume and up -- pricing down in the upcoming quarter to net roughly flat. Is that the sector – is that segment -- ?"
Kurt Adzema,1,Yes. We think datacom overall on a revenue basis will be relatively flat in fiscal Q1.
Alex Henderson,1,"Okay. Can you give us any of the pings and pongs on what's going on there in terms of mix between fall off and LR growth in CWDM4, what segments you're seeing pricing pressure in most aggressively, what's going on with AOC or what's going on with PSM?"
Kurt Adzema,1,"Well, I'd say for us again the main areas we focus on are LR4 and CWDM4. I would say we're seeing the most price erosion in CWDM4, but I also think that's where we're seeing the most unit growth as well."
Alex Henderson,1,"Has the pricing accelerated to the downside, stabilized? I mean it fell off pretty hard last year in CWDM4 in the back half, but it seems like it was stabilizing somewhat. Have you seen any reduction in the rate of decline? Can you give us any kind of trajectory to that?"
Kurt Adzema,1,"I think as Michael said, we are continuing to see ASP pressure, so prices up for CWDM4 continued to decline. I wouldn't say the pace of decline is accelerating, but the prices certainly continue to decline."
Alex Henderson,1,"One last question, and I will cede the floor. The Sherman, I mean the Allen plant, have you fixed your yield issues over there?"
Michael Hurlston,1,"Yes. I mean I wouldn't say we're out of the woods on yield, but I think we've made substantial improvements in the yield and we've used some of the slowdown that's occurred. Kurt talked about the lack of absorption. We've used some of the time period to where we weren't in full production to work on yield issues."
Alex Henderson,1,Great. I’ll cede the floor. Thank you very much.
Operator,1,Your next question comes from James Kisner with Loop. Your line is open.
James Kisner,1,"Thank you so much. So just another question on 3D sensing. Just I was hoping you can maybe quantify how much impact you're seeing from the [indiscernible] absorption in Allen, and is there another way, if that production did not exist, what would your gross margin have been. Is it fair to say your gross margin is negative on 3D sensing at this point. And I'm just wondering what you're expecting in terms of impact from this in the coming quarter from Allen under absorption if at all?"
Kurt Adzema,1,"Well, our revenues as expected were relatively low for 3D sensing in this quarter and obviously we've created a lot of expenses both in terms of capital equipment as well as people to handle higher demands, and I think as Michael mentioned, we expect to see increase in demand in our fiscal Q2."
James Kisner,1,Is there some negative impact from 3D sensing in Q1 that you could maybe help us understand what the impact is?
Kurt Adzema,1,"I'd say the impact in general -- the volumes that we plan to produce aren't going to be materially different from quarter-to- quarter, so we'll continue to have that impact in our Q1, but obviously as we start to ramp production and capacity again in Q2, that should help the under absorption problem."
James Kisner,1,"So gross margins, you are going to be up sequentially. Is that still a factor in the coming quarters like why are margins going up sequentially?"
Michael Hurlston,1,"I think it's mostly due to mix. Our mix is such that we see the margins going up, and overall we've got a favorable -- Kurt talked about the 100 gig. I think we will see more 100 gig coming online and that's going to help the gross margin number."
Kurt Adzema,1,"I think the other thing ias we talked about part of the reason for the lower gross margins in Q4 versus Q3 were non-cash inventory reserves, and that’s basically a mathematical calculation having to do with the fact that revenues were declining. Now we're forecasting revenues to start to grow in Q1 and so that should -- we shouldn't have that same level of impact in Q1 that we saw in Q4."
James Kisner,1,"Okay. Just last follow up on 3D, and I will pass it. I think you said in your release that datacom was down sequentially driven mostly by 3D sensing, but datacom was down, I think $18 million sequentially so that would imply that you were down at least $9 million in 3D in this quarter, is that right and with 3D down by more than half sequentially? Thanks."
Kurt Adzema,1,"You can certainly deduce that. But there were other products as well. I would say 40 gig in general tends to decline as well. But as we said primarily, it was the 3D laser arrays."
James Kisner,1,"So, [indiscernible] stable then it sounds like, 10 gig?"
Kurt Adzema,1,"10-gig was actually relatively flat last quarter. So, I don't know if I'd say stable, but I would say last quarter was flat relative to Q3."
James Kisner,1,Okay. Thanks so much. I'll pass it.
Operator,1,Your next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Simon Leopold,1,"Great. Thanks for taking question. First I just wanted to clarify what I think is obvious, 3D is reported in your datacom segment, correct?"
Kurt Adzema,1,Correct.
Simon Leopold,1,And at some point would you break it out if it does become material enough as a separate line. Is that your expectation or do you expect to include it in datacom forever?
Kurt Adzema,1,I think as it becomes material then we will break it out. We're just not at that point yet.
Simon Leopold,1,"Okay. And I wanted to ask about what's going on with QSFP28. It sounds like you had good volume, but when I read the press release, you pointed to the 3D and the VSCEL production as the factors pressuring your gross margin. I would have guessed pricing and QSFP28 would have also been an element to the -- the lower than expected gross margin. And is that part of it, am I just in correcting that assumption. Could you help us with the gross margin bridge?"
Kurt Adzema,1,"Well, again I think -- there's two different questions, but if you're asking why it was lower than expected in terms of our guidance then I would say it was the under absorption and the non-cash inventory reserves. As we talked about in the last call, we did expect price erosion in CWDM for this quarter. And there definitely was price erosion but that was built into the guide."
Simon Leopold,1,"So you would characterize as an element for the relatively low gross margin versus historical, but not a surprise in the quarter. Is that fair?"
Kurt Adzema,1,I would say I don't think pricing for CWDM 4 was a surprise for the quarter.
Simon Leopold,1,And you were you offered us some commentary on the CapEx for the first quarter and it does look like maybe there's some timing issues versus April. Can you help us understand what your CapEx budget is for the full fiscal '19?
Kurt Adzema,1,"What I would say, let's kind of break it up into three components. I would say for the core business we'll probably spend approximately $25 million a quarter on CapEx. I think for the Wuxi what's remaining on the Wuxi building. I would expect to spend, let's say $8 million to $10 million some of that as I've mentioned is going to happen this quarter, I think the rest will be primarily in Q2 as we finish that building.
And then, I think as you look at Sherman as I mentioned I think this quarter, we are going to probably spent about $100 million of CapEx and then I think in subsequent quarters probably going to spend another I'd say at least 20 to 30 primarily to improve the facility, so that we can easily or more quickly add capacity as we move beyond Phase 1 hopefully sometime in the future."
Simon Leopold,1,"Thanks. And that 20 to 30 you're mentioning that's for the balance of the year, or is that per quarter?"
Kurt Adzema,1,"That's for -- that would be for the balance of the year assuming we spend roughly $100 million this quarter. Obviously, trying to time the exact timing of equipment and invoicing and stuff is a little bit challenging. But yes that's assuming we spent the full $100 million this quarter."
Simon Leopold,1,"And given the spending and the timing when do you expect the Sherman facility to be in meaningful production? Do you still think of the fall timeframe, should we think even if September, October or is that later than that?"
Michael Hurlston,1,"Yes. I think we've said fall and I think October I'd say is generally the earliest we'd expect it, but I think a lot is going to depend on customer quals and things that are somewhat out of our control. But we're currently planning to be early fourth quarter to be online."
Simon Leopold,1,Great. Thank you for taking the questions.
Operator,1,Your next question comes from Doug Clark with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Doug Clark,1,"Hey, great. I actually want to follow up on the question just on CapEx. And I know there's some timing element into it, but based on your comments from last quarter, the Sherman facility CapEx should have been about double what it actually was in the April quarter. So I understand some of that falling into July. I just want to be clear does that impact again at all the timing and perhaps push out the eventual full production of Sherman later into 2013 relative to what you'd previously been expecting?"
Kurt Adzema,1,"Yes. So I think in terms of the CapEx you are right. There was a little bit lower than expected in Q4. I will say that we actually spent that. At the end of Q4, we had $16 million of prepayments as it related to equipment that are not recognized as CapEx until the equipment is actually there and installed. So that 27 and change is a little deceiving relative to the forecast we had before.
In terms of timing, I think Michael said, just answered the question which is we expect to have this facility up and running by the end of the calendar year and I think that's consistent with what we said in March so."
Doug Clark,1,Okay. Can you -- on the $9 million in product write down took in the quarter. Can you be a little bit more specific into what product areas that that was derived from?
Kurt Adzema,1,"We obviously it's highly confidential information. We'd prefer our competitors don't know. But obviously I think as Michael have said, I think one of the things we're trying to do is drive a more focused product strategy and as a result of that and obviously we have to take reserves and write offs as necessary, but we're not going to delineate exactly that.
But I'd say our primary focus right now is cost reducing the 100 gig. So we've talked about and then getting ready for the 400-gig transition that's starting in calendar '19."
Doug Clark,1,"Okay. And then, final question from me actually two parter. Number one, it looked like there was $3 million of startup costs that were non-GAAP. And I'm assuming that's kind of the incremental costs from Sherman. So I just wanted to be clear, if that's right, is that kind of the right incremental expense that we should start to see from the Sherman facility as you start to produce out of it.
And then, your point on the gross margins on the non-cash reserve. I just want to be clear that was not included in non-GAAP, correct? So when you're talking about that impact as an incremental negative versus expectations that was strictly GAAP, right?"
Kurt Adzema,1,"Yes. So a couple of things. Let's talk about Sherman first. You are right. The $3 million startup costs that relates to the Sherman fab as we talked about last time, I think the prior quarter was about 600k. Obviously, we're hiring a lot more people, training people getting machines installed et cetera. And I expect that number to increase as we get closer and closer to production. And then once we're in production -- volume production then those costs will get largely absorbed by the production of products if that makes sense. But we're not providing guidance, but I would expect that number to continue to increase over time."
Doug Clark,1,And then…
Kurt Adzema,1,"Your second question on non-cash reserves that does impact our non-GAAP results. So any reserve that goes up that does impact our non-GAAP result. So it does have -- we don't non-GAAP that out. Anything if we discontinuing products that's a different story but it's just normal E&O reserve, inventory reserves that go up it doesn't -- that does impact non-GAAP."
Doug Clark,1,Okay. Got it. Thanks a lot guys.
Operator,1,Thank you. The next question comes from Joseph Wolf with Barclays. Your line is open.
Joseph Wolf,1,"Thank you. Question on the breadth and the depth of the 100 g market. If you look at the data center customers now versus a year ago where you think it will be a year from now. How do you think that's doing in terms of port growth and your opportunities out there? And how much more, is the pricing decline normalized, are we inflicting on the price declines in that market as you look at the opportunity?"
Michael Hurlston,1,"Yes. I think first as we look out in across the near term, I think the port count is going to continue to grow. We've seen some pretty robust forecasts from our customers and the numbers are going to continue to grow. I think Kurt talked about the pricing. What I would say there is that it continues to decline. I don't think that the rate is abnormal, but we don't see the bottom yet either. I think it's continuing to fall, it's sort of a straight line and I don't think we've reached bottom yet unfortunately."
Joseph Wolf,1,"Is that a global phenomenon meaning if you can't get your customers 100 g a year ago versus now, where are you in terms of the expansion of that market?"
Michael Hurlston,1,"Yes. I think we continue to see opportunity at our traditional OEMs. In fact the OEM opportunity has increased on 100 gig. We've talked about it in previous calls Web 2.0 customers. The Web 2.0, they have transitioned, Kurt, I think talked about in the last call from LR4 to CWDM4. And we see that transition now almost all the way through. I think our exposure to the Web 2.0 customers certainly and looking forward I think we'll get better. But at the moment we're really only exposed to one."
Joseph Wolf,1,"Okay. And then just jumping to 3D sensing for a moment. You mentioned the [indiscernible] nine wins, just the timing on that, the ability or the flexibility to service those customers and if you look out a year, this is still going to be predominantly handset or will there be a couple of design wins contributing to revenue from that?"
Michael Hurlston,1,"Near term, I'd say it's mostly handset. As we talked about in the remarks, we talked about an automotive design win we definitely see a lot of activity in that sector. But I think production is in calendar year 2019 maybe early 2020. Some of the other opportunities are not as big, but we see production volumes happening even at the end of this year and some of these more specialized areas that involve 3D Sensing. But we're definitely starting to see additional traction in the handset stays which is the highest volume opportunity."
Joseph Wolf,1,All right. Thank you.
Operator,1,Your next question comes from Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.
Mark Kelleher,1,"Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Just want to go back to a couple of other questions and go a little deeper. You just mentioned the transition from LR4 to CWDM4. Where are you in terms of your mix within those 2? So my question is, even if CWDM4 were to stabilize in pricing, is there still a headwind because of the shift."
Kurt Adzema,1,"Yes. Well, I think -- again I think there continues to be a shift. I mean we are still selling LR4, what the equilibrium point is, the asymptote is I don't think we quite know. But I think more importantly, I think as Michael has talked about the growth is primarily driven by the data center customers. And so since they tend to buy more CWDM4, I would expect our mix to continue to move towards CWDM4 and that's -- it is definitely already the majority both in terms of units and in revenue so."
Mark Kelleher,1,Okay. That's helpful. And you talked about cost reduction benefits helping gross margins there. Is that something that is going to come in shortly or is that something that's longer we could expect some gross margin help longer term from those -- on those efforts.
Michael Hurlston,1,"I think a lot is going to depend on customer pickup, but we have a couple of phases of cost reduction in play. One that's very near term, and then one that's more at the end of the calendar year. It's still depending on customer quals and cycles and things of that nature which is probably a little premature to call. But it's a continued focus of ours. And as I say we've got a couple of platforms that we're planning introduce one very, very near term and one further out and a lot is going to depend on quals and customer acceptance."
Mark Kelleher,1,"Okay. And then just a clarification, the 3 million Sherman fab cost in the quarter. Was that in -- was that taken out of non-GAAP."
Kurt Adzema,1,"Yes. The $3million is non-GAAP fab, that's correct."
Mark Kelleher,1,"Okay. Just wanted to double check that. Okay, thanks."
Operator,1,Your next question comes from the line of Michael Genovese with MKM Partners. Your line is open.
Michael Genovese,1,"Thanks very much. First of all, I guess I'm still confused by the guidance for gross margins in the current quarter up sequentially. Besides the reserve being less, I don't understand the product mix -- commentary the better product mix is going to drive the improvement. I mean is that all WSS. I heard Michael talk about 100 g as part of the reason but I find 100 g datacom is putting pressure on the gross margin. So can you help clarify just what in the product mix drives the better first quarter gross margins?"
Kurt Adzema,1,"Yes. I'd say there's multiple things. So as I said first, I do think there'll be less non-cash inventory reserve impact this quarter. So that's one thing, number two, just revenue growth to begin with. We had as you know quite a decline last quarter and revenue growth had impacted our gross margins as we kind of turn the corner here for growth that should improve our gross margins. Yes, a fair amount of that growth is on the WSS side. And WSS tend to have higher gross margins than our overall product.
I think what Michael has talked about 100 gig, we are seeing some increase more in CFP and CFP 2. And so those carry as we know higher than average margin. So I think that was more common around CFP, CFP2 than CWDM4. And we're doing a lot to reduce costs here. I think Michael has said there is a lot of focus at the organization to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency. And I think we're starting to see some of the benefits of that. But as Michael pointed out that's going to happen over multiple quarters over the fiscal year. So we're doing a lot to improve gross margins. They're still not where we need them to be obviously, but as he said it's certainly nice that gross margins in fiscal Q1 are expected to be better than Q4."
Michael Genovese,1,"Great. And then, when you talk about that CFP, CFP2 coming back or improving a bit, is that primarily in China or is that in other geographies, and could you just make a more general broader statement about what you think about China here over the next couple of quarters?"
Kurt Adzema,1,"Yes. I'll take the CFP, CFP2 question. Yes. It is primarily from China. So again, not huge but it's certainly beneficial in the quarter or expected to be beneficial in the quarter. I will let Michael handle the broader China question."
Michael Hurlston,1,"I think in the last call there were certainly a lot of questions about what we were seeing on ROADMs in China. I would say that as Kurt talked about in his comments, we are seeing growth in ROADMs, some of that is China. Some of that is China deployment. I would say more of it actually related to India, but we definitely are seeing some growth in China. The overall market -- the rest of the market, I'd still say is flattish for us aside from the CFP2 skew that that Kurt just talked to. So generally we're not seeing a lot of excitement in China still, but we are seeing some pockets of growth."
Michael Genovese,1,"Okay, great. And if you don't mind, if I just to ask one more, you talked about this 12% to 15% operating margin target. And then, you have a lot of -- it sounds like new strategic plans. Can you share any hint of those plans, that's for instance would you be selling components in additions to modules or would you be using more contract manufacturers in your mix than you currently use now or anything else that would, how we get from here to there."
Michael Hurlston,1,"Yes. I think the details certainly come out. I'm not sure we're ready to signal everything. I think that as Kurt said a couple of times to multiple different people, I think a lot of things are on the table. We've turned over lots of rocks and I think that we've generated out of that some good ideas too. As I said in my remarks shift the product mix a bit, focus I think in the transceiver market on higher generating -- higher margin generating products. And I think the result of all that will certainly get us to a much higher operating margins."
Michael Genovese,1,Thanks again.
Operator,1,"[Operator Instructions] The next question is from George Notter with Jefferies. Your line is open. George Notter, please go ahead."
George Notter,1,"Hey, sorry. My I guess -- I was interested in more on China. I mean thinking about the different trade issues that are out there right now. Obviously, you have a larger exposure at Huawei vis-à-vis ZTE, but do you see anything on the horizon in terms of trade or in terms of the environment that could impact your business there. Thanks."
Kurt Adzema,1,"Yes. I'd start with the first comment, which is for us ZTE is certainly not a huge customer. So I think that we probably have less exposure there than some. And generally it's uncertain, I think nobody can call what's going on in China, it seems to change every single day as you all know. And the good news for us is, I don't think it's impacted business for us. As I say ZTE is not particularly a large customer of ours and we're continuing to wobble on. But I think generally speaking, it's just a very uncertain environment at the moment."
George Notter,1,Thank you.
Operator,1,Your next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Meta Marshall,1,"Great. Thanks. First question just as your OpEx guidance would kind of imply a downtick from fiscal Q4 and just as you talked about cost improvements, would you see it kind of declining from this level or could it kind of stay stabilized at this level for the fiscal year just how we should think about that.
And then, second question, just on triple camera and just whether you see that as complementary or substitutional, kind of some of the 3D Sensing technology that you guys are working on? Thanks."
Kurt Adzema,1,"Yes. I think we talked about in my remarks that we would like to see OpEx in the 18% to 20% range. And you're right, we've had a step down in OpEx from quarter-over-quarter and I think that we'll see continued step downs on the OpEx line. Again, we think we need to be in this 18% to 20% range to run our business effectively. And we definitely want to get there.
Relative again to 3D Sensing and triple camera, obviously the big opportunity is in handsets and we're seeing a lot of different things there. We're seeing opportunities in virtual reality and gaming. There's definitely a lot of froth and I think we're focused near term on trying to capture as much of that opportunity as possible. Triple camera, we're seeing some interest in that. Obviously, you're right that's an opportunity, but I think the near term game is a real focus on these handset opportunities."
Meta Marshall,1,Got it.
Operator,1,Your next question comes from Tim Savageaux with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Tim Savageaux,1,"Hi, good afternoon. I want to focus back on the strategic front really on both the prospects for increasing the company's focus on the device, I mean component space relative to modules and we've seen that demonstrated both very recently. And within the last few years by various participants across the space with some pretty salutary gross margin results and/or speaking to the company's manufacturing footprint, which you continue to expand at least from a capital spending standpoint. Last quarter I think you said you may come back to us with more specifics, I'm really heard a lot of specifics and maybe I'd like to press a little bit and say what you're guiding to from a OpEx standpoint implies gross margins still in the mid-30s. Obviously, the company has done much higher operating margins as a standalone prior to that. So and that's with the VSCEL ramp that's much higher margin. So it sort of implies status quo. So is the result here after -- four or five months in the chair were kind of good as we are or would you like to expand on or maybe other plans and directions you might be heading."
Michael Hurlston,1,"You touched on a couple of good points. I think number one, we certainly recognize the opportunity in the component sector. I think 3D sensing in some respect is that I think the 3D sensing component opportunity is different for us it's obviously not a module sale. And I think as we get Sherman online certainly more of the revenue of the company will be coming from the 3D sensing opportunity and that's component based. I think that there is opportunity for us which we haven't done in the past to sell our components into traditional optics opportunities. At this point, we haven't fully explored that and so how that's going to contribute for us down the road, we don't know. I think you touched on another point which is the manufacturing footprint. I think that has something again that's very much under review.
Certainly as we embark on lasers, we continued to manufacture those and we think that's an important marriage between the design and manufacture of the lasers. As you look at the module assembly type of play and our manufacturing footprint there that's something that we're looking at to see if we can build in some more flexibility into that footprint. So in regards to your sort of overall conclusion that it's the status quo, I can understand where you're coming from, but I think at the same point in time, I think there's a lot of pieces that are moving under the covers that you can't quite see yet."
Tim Savageaux,1,"All right. Well, I guess I'll follow up and say that -- if the end game of those pieces moving is, 35% gross and 12% to 15% operating, which is the place you've been before. And you could easily get just on of VCSEL ramp what's the point of doing that I guess, right?"
Kurt Adzema,1,"Well, Tim I don't think anything in this industry is easily done. I think our competitors would agree to that. So I think we have a lot of work to do and obviously we're very disappointed in our results. But if even to get to the range Michael is talking about I think there's a lot of work to get done from the 1.5% EBIT which was obviously unacceptable that we had this quarter.
So there's absolutely no status quo going on here having been there for 13 years. I can tell you that. So I think we're working on a lot of things. I think we're making trying to put a lot of things in place to make this company successful and our expectation that it will be successful. We're just not at the point where we're going to delineate all that for you and our competitors."
Tim Savageaux,1,"Fair enough. If I could follow up with one quick business question kind of operational. You've had various competitors and suppliers talk about CWDM4 unit volumes kind of doubling in the second half of the year doubling again in '19. Or in some cases unit volume forecasts for CWDM4 unit is high as 10 million or calendar '19, I'd be interested in your thoughts on any of those metrics either kind of directionally or in absolute terms."
Michael Hurlston,1,"I think we definitely see growth in the market I'm not sure it's that high but we definitely see the growth that we talked to earlier. Port counts are going up. I think across the Web 2.0 landscape, we see those numbers increasing. We've seen some significant forecast jumps by some of our customers, I'm not sure as with all forecasts, I'm not sure you believe everything you see. I'd say directionally you're right, it's up. I think the magnitude sounds a little high."
Tim Savageaux,1,Thanks.
Operator,1,Your next question comes from Richard Shannon with Craig-Hallum Capital. Your line is open.
Richard Shannon,1,"Great. Guys thanks for taking my questions as well. Maybe just two for me. First on the datacom side of your business, I guess a two part question for Michael. You mentioned specifically 400 gig, are you seeing any opportunities in 200 gig. And if so when might those arise, do you provide any thought process and how to think about the timing for 400 gig in any real volume?"
Michael Hurlston,1,"Yes. I mean let me start with the first question. I think on 200 gig, we certainly are seeing opportunities and I think that those have the potential of being near term than the 400 gig opportunity. I think the 400 gig we're seeing sort of late calendar '19. I think we talked about that in the last call and I think that the timing of that is still in that area sort of an early ramp I would call it in calendar - late calendar '19. The 200 gig opportunity is maybe mid-'19, but we're definitely seeing a couple of customers talk in a more meaningful way about 200 gig."
Richard Shannon,1,"Okay. But on 200 gig, you're not seeing anything this year than sounds like you're seeing?"
Michael Hurlston,1,That's right.
Richard Shannon,1,"Okay. Fair enough. My last and final question on kind of your enterprises within datacom, maybe just give us a general thought process on the trends there what you've seen in April, what you're seeing for the rest of the year in terms of growth."
Kurt Adzema,1,"Well, again, I think Michael touched on probably the biggest part right. The biggest part of our datacom business is, is the Web 2.0 space and it's QSFP28 market. And I think in general what we've said is we expect unit growth to continue to grow. We continue to see pricing pressure there and so the challenges, but obviously we don't predict more than one quarter out, but trying to figure out exactly how those trade offs happen in the coming quarter. But I'd say relatively flattish is our near term expectation."
Richard Shannon,1,"Kurt, I apologize. Maybe I'll rephrase it improperly, but I was asking more on the lower speed enterprise stuff 10 gig fiber channel et cetera."
Kurt Adzema,1,"Sure. Sorry. Yes, 10 gig as we said last quarter was relatively flat. This quarter we actually expected to be flat as well. But certainly, we expect 10 gig to decline over time. As we've talked about in the past, part of our challenge is that we've probably held on to the 10 gig business longer than most and not the greatest gross margin business due to our vertical integration strategy. And so I expect that business to decline over time, but certainly last quarter was relatively flattish, this quarter we expect relatively flattish, but I expect that to decline in subsequent quarters.
The 40 gig side, we see that continuing to decline. It declined last quarter are expected to decline several million dollars this quarter as well as people continue to transition from 40-gig to 100-gig. And fiber channel, I would say relatively stable."
Richard Shannon,1,Okay perfect. That's all I had. Thanks guys.
Operator,1,Your next question comes from Dave Kang with B. Riley. Your line is open.
Dave Kang,1,"Thank you. Good afternoon. Just couple of questions on 3D, first of all can you talk about the competitive landscape on the VSCEL size. I was like we thought maybe there would be three but it sounds like there could be more than three. And then, second question is on the edge emitters for 3DS, are you or will you be working on edge emitters for 3DS?"
Michael Hurlston,1,"Yes. I would say the competitive landscape continues to be us to six momentum. There's definitely talk from others that they're trying to get in the market. But I think right now we see it as a sort of a three horse race. Again, I think our position is well documented in that market and we continue to believe that it's a good market with plenty of room for multiple people, if additional people enter, the growth rate of the market is strong.
I'd say on the second question and I forget the second question is David. Yes, sorry. Yes. I think there was a lot of noise about edge meters certainly we make an edge emitting laser and I think that there's a lot of noise around that. But we certainly have seen that dissipate. I don't think the customers seem nearly as excited about edge emitters as they were, let's say even a quarter ago. So we're working on all the different aspects of 3D sensing you've got structured light, we've got time of flight. Those are our focus areas and certainly that's where we see much more of the customer traction."
Dave Kang,1,"Got it. And then, my last question is on the high power versus the low power VSCEL's, your main competitor is making both whereas you were just focusing on high power. Assuming or when Sherman facilities fully running. Will you be making both or just continue to focus on high powered chips."
Michael Hurlston,1,Yes. I mean I think it depends on customer opportunity. All right. I think right now we're on the higher power side of the equation and we certainly can make low power. But I think it's all going to depend on customer demand and customer opportunity.
Dave Kang,1,Got it. Thank you.
Operator,1,That's all the time that we have for questions today. I turn the call back to presenters for any closing remarks.
Michael Hurlston,1,I want to thank everybody for attending. I think it was a good call and I appreciate everybody's time and attendance. We look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Thank you.
Operator,1,This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.
