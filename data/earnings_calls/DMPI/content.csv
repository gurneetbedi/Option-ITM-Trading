Saiid Zarrabian,0,"Good afternoon and thank you for taking the time to join us on today's teleconference. I'm going to make my prepared remarks brief as the past quarter and the foreseeable future is purely about executing on a highly defined and publicly disclosed development plan for VAL-083, our therapeutic platform asset.
Over the past 12 months our efforts have been simply focused on running the most streamlined and efficient clinical and corporate operational organization [process] [ph] while at the same time exploring opportunities to enhance the composite of the company's value proposition via the announcement of the appointment of Oppenheimer & Co. in September to serve as our strategic advisor.
In this capacity, Oppenheimer & Co. is working on behalf of DelMar to identify and evaluate a wide range of strategic opportunities with the specific goal of facilitating shareholder value generation.
In regards to our drug development efforts, our fundamental objective is to continue to rapidly and efficiently advance VAL-083 two Phase 2 biomarker driven clinical trials for MGMT-unmethylated GBM at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, and at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center in Guangzhou, China. In addition, we will explore within reason from a financial and resource perspective VAL-083’s potential to treat solid tumors in additional oncology indications.
Turning into our clinical trials with respect to our open-label, second-line, Avastin-naïve study being conducted at MD Anderson Cancer Center, I'm pleased to report that during the quarter the trial continued to enroll at a faster pace than originally forecasted.
As of October 31st the trial which we have labeled the MDACC study has enrolled 44 of the planned total of 48 patients. As you may recall the rationale for the second-line recurrent GBM trial which was initiated in February of 2017 is based on the fact that approximately two thirds of newly diagnosed GBM patients are grossly underserved via current therapies as they have tumors with unmethylated MGMT promoter, which is correlated with high expression of the DNA repair enzyme MGM T.
It has been scientifically established that patients whose tumors exhibit high expression of MGM T have a poor prognosis and significantly shorter progression free survival and overall survival in comparison to patients with an unmethylated MGMT promoter and a low MGMT expression using currently approved therapies.
The goal of the MD Anderson study is straightforward. To determine if treatment with VAL-083 improves overall survival for those patients who have progressed on temozolomide compared to historical control. Based on recent increased enrollment rates, we’re continuing to forecast full enrollment by year-end 2018, some nine plus months earlier than originally planned. This forecast with the caveat that the U.S. Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays may slightly impact patient enrollment rates.
Moving to our Phase 2 trial for first-line newly diagnosed MGMT-unmethylated GBM patients being conducted at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center in Guangzhou, China, which commenced in September of 2017.
Similar to the MD Anderson study, I am pleased to report that during the quarter we experienced an increased rate of enrollment. As of October 31, 2018 we have enrolled 10 of a total of up to 30 patients in the study. As a reminder, the patients in this trial are being treated with VAL- 083 in combination with radiotherapy as a potential alternative to the current standard-of-care which is temozolomide and radiation regimen, which is currently the first-line treatment for this patient population.
From an operational standpoint this trial is being conducted under the terms of our collaboration with Guangxi Wuzhou Pharmaceutical Company. That is - the study’s principal clinical goals are to confirm the safety of the three day every 21 day VAL-083 dosing regimen in combination with radiotherapy and to investigate progression free and overall survival outcomes of the combination of VAL-083 and radiotherapy in MGMT-unmethylated patients. To date, dose confirming cohort studies have been completed.
Based on the dose conformation phase of the study, we have selected 30 mg per metre squared for combination with radiation with – for the treatment of newly diagnosed MGMT-unmethylated GBM patients during this trial.
In addition to the status of the Phase 2 studies, I wanted to provide a brief update regarding our publications at last week's SNO conference. At the annual meeting of society-for-neurooncology meeting five abstracts were presented by DelMar, two of which involved our two Phase 2 studies.
First, we provided an update on the MD Anderson study in the poster entitled, Phase 2 study of VAL-083 in patients with MGMT-unmethylated, Bevacizumab-Naïve Recurrent Glioblastoma.
As already noted, we reported that as of October 31 of 2018 44 of 48 patients had been enrolled, 41 of those patients had received at least one cycle of VAL-083 at the date of cut off, 7 patients are currently receiving treatment. 22 are being followed for survival and 19 are deceased thus far.
Study subjects had received a median of two cycles of therapy with 12 patients receiving one cycle of VAL-083, two patients have received one cycle and still on treatment and 27 patients have completed two or more cycles of therapy with VAL-083.
Of the 27 subjects that completed at least two cycles of treatment, nine out of 27, 33.3%, exhibited stable disease at the end of cycle 2. This included 8 of 23 who initially received the starting dose of 40 mgs per metre squared and one out of four who initially received the starting dose of 30 mg per metre squared.
We also provide an update on our China study in a poster titled Phase 1, 2 study of VAL-083 with radiation therapy in Newly Diagnosed MGMT-unmethylated Glioblastoma. We reported the study has now enrolled 10 of the planned 30 patients and the dose of 30 mg per meter squared has been chosen as the dose for the treatment of the remaining patients in the study.
Also at SNO we provided new preclinical data that continues to support the potential combination studies with VAL-083 in potential for treatment of additional cancer indications, as well as gaining additional insights into VAL-083’s unique mechanism of action. With respect to a combination study, our preclinical data showed strong in vivo anti tumor efficacy of VAL-083 against MGMT-unmethylated temozolomide resistant recurrent GBM. This effect was further augmented in combination with Avastin providing a rationale for clinical investigation for our VAL-083 in combination with Avastin in the treatment of GBM.
Second indication was diffused intrinsic pontine glioma or called DIPG is a brain cancer that impacts the glial cells at the base of the brain. We presented preclinical study highlights that the combination of VAL-083 and AZD1775 which is that Wee1 kinase inhibitor might be a promising new therapeutic strategy for children with DIPG. Ongoing studies were continued to assess that in vivo activity, as well as explore the underlying mechanism of action of this combination therapy strategy.
Finally, we examined the efficacy of VAL-083 against a panel of eight GBM cells isolated from newly diagnosed GBM patients. Our results showed that VAL-083 inhibits neurosphere formation all eight GBM stem cells. It was found that VAL-083 affects the expression of several proteins and phosphoproteins central to GBM growth. This is a salient and important finding because these proteins have been implicated in several cancers, including GBM.
In summary, we reported that VAL-083 is effective in halting the growth of the panel of GBM cells. With respect to the full breadth of VAL-083s treatment potential, this is an area of particular future interest for myself and Dennis Brown, Delmar's cofounder and our Chief Scientific Officer. As we have stated before, VAL-083 may represent a great opportunity in treating multiple solid tumors in a broad range of oncology indications.
With the new data from our ongoing efforts supported by over 40 clinical trials completed by the National Cancer Institute, we will continue to evaluate additional indications where VAL-083 may provide better treatment options for these underserved patients, and we will strive to do so in a fiscally responsible fashion.
We at DelMar are working with our world-class partners at MD Anderson Cancer Center, at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center in China, as well as with our Ovarian Advisory Board to enhance outcomes for underserved oncology patients. Towards this goal, we appreciate the trust our stakeholders have placed upon us in our efforts to find ways to help our target population in the most cost effective, efficient and effectively possible.
At this juncture, I’ll turn the call over to Scott Praill, our CFO, who will provide a summary of our financial profile for the quarter ending September 30, 2018. Scott?"
Scott Praill,0,"Thank you, Saiid, and thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon. I'm going to provide a have high level review of our financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2018. I like to remind everyone that our full financial results for the quarter ended September 30 2018 are available in our Form 10-Q filed with the SEC at sec.gov. This SEC filing it's also available on our website at delmarpharma.com under the Investors tab.
For the three months ended September 30, 2018, the company reported a net loss of $1,991,804 million [ph] or $0.09 per share, compared to a net loss of $2,666,406, million [ph] or $0.18 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2017.
Research and development expenses decreased to approximately $1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2018 from approximately $1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017. The decrease was largely attributable to a decrease in clinical development costs with smaller impacts from a decrease in intellectual property and travel expenses. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in non-cash, share-based compensation expense during the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017.
General and administrative expenses increased during the three months ended September 30, 2018 to approximately $1 million from approximately $740,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2017, largely due to an increase in non-cash, share-based compensation expense incurred in the current quarter compared to the prior quarter.
With respect to our cash resources based on our updated budget that reflects the strategic development of DelMar, we believe we have cash resources to fund our planned operation to the middle of calendar year 2019. If anyone has any questions I would be happy to answer them during the Q&A session at the end of the call.
I'd like to now pass the call back to Saiid. Saiid?"
Saiid Zarrabian,0,"Thank you, Scott. I would conclude by thanking our longstanding shareholders for your continued support as we continue to progress our strategic plan, the management and board of Delmore pharmaceuticals to remain dedicated to executing the clinical and corporate growth plan I’ve outlined during today's call.
I will now turn the call over to the operator to commence a brief question and answer section of this teleconference."
Operator,1,"[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from [Jim Tuffy] [ph], a private investor. Please go ahead."
Jim Tuffy,1,"Hi, guys. Nice poster sessions. Can you all hear me?"
Saiid Zarrabian,1,Yeah.
Jim Tuffy,1,"Oh, good. So I'm a little - I'm trying to do the math. I don't understand how you can get middle of 2018 cash unless someone else is hoping to pay some bills or unless someone is augmenting the bills like MD Anderson. Are you anticipating any contribution from other sources?"
Saiid Zarrabian,1,"Scott, I'll start and maybe you can help enhance. Jim, we – our projections for getting into the middle of 2018 is based purely on the current cash available on hand. So no contributions, no additional capital et cetera. And part of the reason is our burn rate has continuously been going down, mainly because there was a tail associated with us parking the original STAR-3 registration study that had expenses that had to be incurred. But those have now completely been incurred by the company.
So we're now running basically the two clinical trials I mentioned, the one at MD Anderson, which we fund at a very good rate and the one in China which we have very little financial obligation to support other than a little bit of safety and providing drug supply. Scott, can you expand on that?"
Scott Praill,1,"So, yeah. So two more points as well Jim, as we’ve noted and during this call as well as on the documents we filed, we anticipate notwithstanding potential slow down for your Thanksgiving and Christmas full enrollment in the MD Anderson trial by the end of this calendar year. So subsequent to that you know, the cost for that [indiscernible] will decrease.
We've also completed for the most part the cost for a drug supply. Those are two main items that are at least partially in this current quarter burn that we will not expect to incur as we move into the next quarter. So…"
Saiid Zarrabian,1,"And that's an important point regarding the MD Anderson because the faster than planned enrollment meant we had to spend a little bit more money in the last two quarters but that is now prepaying effectively the future because one of the last patient is enrolled, all of our costs have been incurred on those patient population."
Jim Tuffy,1,"So the second question has to do with China, it seems like they're a little sluggish in enrollment. Is that your perception as well and what is being done to accelerate that because it seems like pretty exciting research."
Saiid Zarrabian,1,"You know, it is a little bit slower than originally planned, but quite a few studies that I've been involved [indiscernible] MD Anderson started a little slower and then speed up came after we kind of worked with them and debug the system. I think we have seen the same paradigm in China. They have screened many, many, many patients, but the ones that are eligible for our trial have been a little slow.
But now we went through a protocol education. We have been speaking to the Chinese partners and I think that has already borne fruit by the accelerated enrollment over the last three or four months. We had a meeting with them at the SNO conference and we're optimistic that the currently enjoyed accelerated enrollment rate will continue going forward."
Jim Tuffy,1,"And lastly with the Oppenheimer relationship and pretty quiet from any vantage point in terms of additional fund raising, clearly not optimal to raise funds at this price per share level, but clearly also partnerships, anything ongoing conversations, anything happening that will get us to that finish line before those very fast six months go by?"
Saiid Zarrabian,1,I would be happy to share with you the information as we get to a place where it's material to the business. But at this point there isn't enough progress on any of the fronts you mentioned…
Jim Tuffy,1,Okay…
Saiid Zarrabian,1,"…to allow me to speak openly about it. But we are exploring in-licensing, out-licensing anything that could add value to the company is being explored in that relationship."
Jim Tuffy,1,All right. Thanks so much.
Saiid Zarrabian,1,"Thanks for the question, Jim."
Scott Praill,1,"Thanks, Jim."
Operator,1,[Operator Instructions] And it appears we have no further questions at this time.
Saiid Zarrabian,1,"Well, again, I thank everybody for your participation. We will be driving the MD Anderson's study with the utmost speed and we hope to be fully enrolled by the end of the year and able to provide data in end of Q1 or the beginning of Q2 calendar year ‘19 as originally projected by the trial design. Thank you everyone. Bye-bye."
Scott Praill,1,"Thank you, everyone."
Dennis Brown,1,Thank you.
Operator,1,This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.
