Operator,0,"Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Perry Ellis International’s fiscal year 2019 first quarter results conference call. As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded.
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on the call either as part of the prepared remarks or in response to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such information is subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the press release and in documents that we have filed with the SEC.
Joining us today for this call from Perry Ellis are Oscar Feldenkreis, Chief Executive Officer and President, and Jorge Narino, Chief Financial Officer. 
I would now like to turn the conference over to Oscar Feldenkreis. Please go ahead."
Oscar Feldenkreis,0,"Thank you for joining our first earnings call for the new fiscal year 2019. We are pleased to report a solid revenue growth and profit. For the first quarter, total revenues increased 5% over last year to $255 million, reflecting a strong performance in golf and Nike swim. This growth continues to be fueled by the strength of our product innovation and the successful execution of our growth initiatives that are focused on higher margin brands, channels, and geographies. We also have benefited from increased replenishments for the spring shipments. Sales across all geographies and channels from a geographical perspective, both North America wholesale and Europe, grew mid-single digits plus 5% across channels. Direct to consumer produced high-single digits of plus-8%, while licensing revenue was up to last year and in line with plan. In total, revenue growth of $14 million over last year was driven by the growth and momentum of our golf brands and Nike Swim, and also includes a re-class of $1.5 million in licensing advertising contribution from SG&A to revenue due to the new accounting revenue recognition rules. This growth was offset by declines in our women’s business.
Adjusted EPS was $0.78, which includes the exit of Bon-Ton, Laundry moving to a licensed business model, and the higher tax rate driven by the reversal of our tax valuation allowance. 
Additional highlights for the year: very strong balance sheet with cash and investments totaling $54 million, which provides us with ample liquidity to facilitate the $50 million bond redemption that took place on May 29; equally strong inventory position at $151 million, substantially down from the year end but slightly up to last year by $11 million, fueling spring shipments; a high-single-digit comp sales increase in direct to consumer accompanied by high teens comp margin increases over last year.
Perry Ellis brand had a strong first quarter highlighted by single-digit growth in the collections business, which was on plan. Despite the late Easter and weather challenges, we did see strength in short sleeved product in Q1. Short sleeve wovens were our best performing category with plus-25% increase over last year. All short sleeve wovens and knit spring products performed above plan. We have seen a strong reaction to the introduction of our Work Plus Play concept anchored by the new uniform, versatile wardrobe staples with performance and easy care features. Our total stretch wovens have been our best performers in this group. Newness is driving the dress pant category, which led our portfolio dress bottoms to have one of the best quarters on record with a plus-25% increase at retail. We have introduced new fabrications and constructions, and our fit offerings today include classic, modern, slim, and very slim. We’re seeing performance fabrics, stretched gripper waistbands, and very slim fit as some of the top performers, which we will be expanding on throughout the year.
Original Penguin had a solid quarter with high-single-digit growth of plus-7%. This performance reflects the success of our innovative product strategy with a push on new branding and logo-driven product. In 2018, we introduced five new versions of the Penguin logo with more development for 2019. Innovation and product drove sales at higher retails, and we continue to focus on elevated distribution within better department stores, ecommerce sites, and specialty stores in the U.S. and Canada. In Europe, Original Penguin had an encouraging retail performance in wholesale and ecommerce with key young fashion retailers. 
In Q1, Callaway saw a high double-digit sales growth of over 25%. Newly introduced and innovative core essential styles led the brand’s growth, featuring stretch, UV protection, ventilation, and cooling technologies. The Callaway ladies plus sizes, a very much in demand category, were successfully introduced for the first time for spring 2018 and will be extended as a major initiative to additional channels and key accounts in fall 2018 and onwards. In looking to the second half of the year, the new Callaway fall 2018 weather series collections pre-booked extremely well and will allow us to further gain market share and make the golf lifestyle all year round business. 
Callaway Europe had double-digit revenue growth despite a challenging business environment. Our growth in revenues and profits speaks to the dominance of the Callaway brand, and we also ship PGA Tour collection to Golf America in the U.K. This puts this exciting brand in a strong position for international expansion. 
Nike Swim experienced a very strong Q1, realizing double-digit growth over the previous year. All geographies grew, with the fastest growing region being Europe. The quarter saw our first shipments to Asia. A shop-in-shop opened this month in Korea at Lotte Department Stores with the support of one of our best-in-class distributor partners. We will be expanding further into Asia during the fourth quarter.
Our plans to expand Nike Swim globally are taking hold nicely. During the quarter, sales generated outside of the United States represented 16% of the total revenues, up mid-single digits from the same quarter last year. We anticipate being in nearly 60 countries during the next swim season. Nike Swim in Europe continues to grow significantly driven through planned territory expansions now operating in 28 markets across EMEA, and the strong reorder demand driven by positive reactions to the spring shipments with comp doors.
Due to the exit of Bon-Ton, Rafaella’s first quarter sales were down to last year. For the balance of fiscal year, we expect revenues to be down; however, our strategy to expand the more casual weekend part of the line and introduce an active capsule was very successful. Rafaella Weekend picked up plus-34% over last year with an increased ticket price. Weekend has grown to 20% of total sales and continues to pick up volume consistent with the month over month. 
Moving into the second quarter, Rafaella will continue to deliver casual capsules monthly throughout the spring and summer season. This will include leggings, sports, and novelty knits that coordinate back to the active element of the line. Dresses will become a larger percentage of the sportswear assortment in the casual easy-to-wear cottons [indiscernible]. Rafaella has expanded its special size offering as this is a big opportunity for the brand.
We continue to advance our strategy, strategic goals, and brand initiatives through licensing. We executed four new agreements in the first quarter of the year, two of which were international markets. We have another four to six new agreements in the pipeline for the second quarter and remain bullish about our medium and long-term licensing prospects. Original Penguin licensing revenues increased plus-24% driven by men’s and boy’s footwear in both domestic and international markets. Continued introduction of product brand’s extensions and growth in international markets also contributed to a strong quarter for the brand. Laundry by Shelli Segal licensing revenues also experienced a rise in revenues due to the new dress license.
Strong comp sales of plus-8% and margins of plus-17% highlighted the performance of our direct to consumer division. High single digit store comps were driven by warm-hot door seasonal product intensification as well as increased in-stock suit position. Ticket increases drove sizeable increases in the average dollar sale. We continue to focus our efforts on SKU reduction and improved in-store presentation which has attracted store foot traffic. Customers responded very well to our Perry Ellis expanded performance driven product assortment in both woven shirts and suits. New OPG - Original Penguin Golf product is selling well in stores and online and will help drive second quarter sales. Our ecommerce websites have added to the comp margin increases. We eliminated low margin and low promotional events from last year, and this strategy has increased our gross margin and quality of our sales. 
As we assess new store locations, we continue to focus on rent reductions as well as our current lease renewal negotiations. We have plans to open two to four new stores this year and feel optimistic of the additional opportunities after returning from the ICS show in Vegas.
Overall, we feel very good about the start of the year and conservatively cautiously plan to hold guidance for the full year. We believe that the company is positioned well to navigate the retail environment and our strong global brands.
Before I turn the call over to our CFO, I would like to remind everyone to please limit your questions to our earnings announcement. We are not able to respond to questions related to the board’s evaluation of strategic alternatives or the board’s nominations made by George Feldenkreis. 
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jorge to review our first quarter financials in more detail."
Jorge Narino,0,"Good morning everyone. Before I begin, I would like to note that the results I will highlight with you on today’s call are on a non-GAAP basis, adjusted for costs to streamline and consolidate our operations as well as other strategic initiatives. We have provided reconciliation tables in the earning release we issued this morning.
Now moving onto our results, we began the year reporting sales and earnings that surpassed our analysts’ estimates. As we presented on our year-end call, fiscal 2019 would see some top line headwinds given the wind down of the Bon-Ton business due to the bankruptcy, and the change in the Laundry dresses to a licensing model. On top of this, we also were impacted by timing of licensing income due to the revenue recognition accounting changes. Despite this, our company grew total sales by 5%, which included strong performances from Nike Swim and golf apparel and a positive comp in our DTC channel.
Let me share our performance in more detail. Consolidated revenues for the first quarter totaled $255 million, an increase of 5.4% on a GAAP basis and 4.5% on a constant currency basis from prior year revenues of $242 million. This increase reflects growth in certain core brands, which I will discuss further momentarily, increases in our direct to consumer businesses and offsets from our women’s business. Revenue in our men’s sportswear and swim segment totaled $200 million as compared to $186 million in the prior year due to higher sales, specifically in golf apparel and Nike Swim. Original Penguin was up slightly. These increases were offset by a slight decrease in Perry Ellis. 
Revenue in our women’s sportswear segment totaled $26 million as compared to $30 million in the prior year. The women’s business declined because of the transition of Laundry dressed to a licensing business. In addition, Rafaella was slightly down, as anticipated, because of the loss of the Bon-Ton sales. As mentioned previously, we expect the transition of Laundry dresses to our licensing partner to bring us a savings in fiscal year 2019 as we remove the costs associated with the business and begin to record licensing revenue.
Direct to consumer revenue totaled $20 million, up 9% from the prior year due to positive comparable store sales of 12.7%. Overall DTC was up 8.2%. Sales rose for the quarter, reflecting strong response to our product assortments. Additionally, the two stores that were closed due to the hurricane at the end of Q3 still remain closed today. 
Licensing revenues rose 19% to $9.8 million as compared to $8.3 million in the prior year. Increases in revenue included a $1.5 million increase due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard which required advertising reimbursements to be classified as revenue instead of as a reduction of the related advertising cost, as was the case in fiscal 2018.
Moving on to total company results, beginning with gross margin, adjusted margins contracted by 60 basis points versus prior year as a result of the mix of the incremental sales as well as the residual close-out of the Bon-Ton inventory. SG&A totaled $75.5 million for the quarter or 29.6% of total sales as compared to $71.2 million or 29.4% of total sales in the prior first quarter. This increase includes a $1.5 million increase due to the adoption of the new revenue standard which requires advertising reimbursements to be classified into revenue instead of as a related advertising cost, as was mentioned previously. On an adjusted basis, SG&A would have been $73.2 million or 28.7% of sales. We continue to maintain cost discipline, effectively managing increases in wages and other inflationary costs that have risen approximately 3 to 4% per year.
Adjusted pre-tax income was $15.6 million, up 7.6% from $14.5 million in the first quarter of 2018. Adjusted net income was $12.1 million, decreasing 5% from $12.8 million in the 2018 first quarter, and adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.78, declining 6% from $0.83 last year.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flows, our balance sheet continues to be strong. Inventories grew 8% versus the first quarter of fiscal 2018, supporting the growth of Nike Swim and including the expansion of our international business. Our net debt to capitalization of 18.9% compared with 24.3% in the first quarter of 2018. In addition, we reduced our borrowings under the credit facility by $2 million to $62.4 million at the end of the quarter. This places us in a very comfortable position to support the expansion of our global business.
Moving onto our outlook, for the full year we continue to expect challenges; however, we are positioned very well in terms of our product focus and our execution and performance. Accordingly, we are maintaining our guidance for revenues at $855 million to $865 million, and adjusted earnings per share for the year of $1.80 to $1.90. The adjusted earnings exclude any potential expenses, which will be significant, to be incurred by the company in connection with the board of directors special committee’s exploration and evaluation of potential strategic alternatives and the related February 6, 2018 proposal to acquire the company. This continues to reflect a gross margin rate of 38.2%.
SG&A is expected to be relatively consistent with adjusted prior year levels, reflecting a disciplined approach to expense management in offsetting inflationary cost pressures. In addition, for the full year we expect a tax rate of 23%. We are expecting operating cash flows to approximate $15 million for fiscal 2018 and our capital expenditures should approximate a range of $9 million to $10 million.
In summary, we continue to be pleased with the performance of our brands and expect our favorable momentum to continue as we capitalize on the power of our global brands and strong sourcing and distribution infrastructure, while maintaining discipline with regards to expense and inventory management. We remain confident we are making the right strategic decisions to position our company for long term success.
Before I turn the call over to the Operator, I would like to remind everyone to please limit your questions to our earnings announcements. We are not able to respond to questions related to the board’s evaluation of strategic alternatives or the board nominations made by George Feldenkreis. 
With that, I will turn the call over to the Operator for Q&A."
Operator,1,"[Operator instructions]
We’ll take our first question from Ronald Bookbinder with IFS Securities."
Ronald Bookbinder,1,Good morning and congratulations on a nice start to the year. 
Oscar Feldenkreis,1,"Thank you, Ron."
Ronald Bookbinder,1,"On the licensing shift, what would Q1 EPS have been had it not been for the licensing shift, and should we expect Q4 EPS to be somewhat inflated by it being back-end loaded on licensing?"
Jorge Narino,1,"The shift that’s occurring in licensing is not going to have a material impact to the quarters. For the year, licensing will remain fairly consistent with what we had last year. The re-class of the $1.5 million has no impact on EPS because it’s just a movement from SG&A up into the revenue line.
What the new revenue standard is causing us to do is to recognize our overages related to our licenses as the overages are occurring, as opposed to more spread pro rata over the year, but it’s not a real material impact to each individual quarter."
Ronald Bookbinder,1,"Okay. Your payables leverage was down to around 35%, the lowest level since Q1 two years ago. With the paying off of the 7.875%debt, should we look for the payables leverage to go back to its typical high 50s?"
Jorge Narino,1,"No, I think it’s just the timing of where we were in terms of our payments at the end of the quarter. I wouldn’t consider this an anomaly, and I would just think that our AP will continue to be more in line with what we normally have at the end of the year."
Ronald Bookbinder,1,"Okay. Penguin Golf, how was that doing?"
Oscar Feldenkreis,1,"We’ve started shipping it now, Ron, in April, and the reception has been very strong across the USA channels, and we feel that that could be a good opportunity for the future for us. It’s small, right now, we’re just starting to deliver it now that the season has started. We’ll have more success and feedback in Q2, Q3."
Ronald Bookbinder,1,"Okay. Rafaella dresses, you’ve got out of the dress business. Why are you getting back into it?"
Oscar Feldenkreis,1,"Rafaella always had dresses. Rafaella is a collection, so they always had dresses. What I meant to say is that they’re adding additional casual pieces to the assortment - that’s all that means, but they might be giving up more dress pants and adding more casual dresses to go with the casualization direction of the brand."
Ronald Bookbinder,1,"Okay, but you have to have designers and all to create that line, and having turned Laundry into a licensing business, why wouldn’t you just license out Rafaella’s dresses also?"
Oscar Feldenkreis,1,"Because the business in Laundry was a classification business and it was social and evening dresses. It has nothing to do. This is really part of a collection. Remember, Rafaella’s collection is comprised of sportswear, so it’s sportswear dresses, that’s all it is. It’s an element really for the spring season, it doesn’t have anything to do with the fall season."
Ronald Bookbinder,1,"Okay, great. All right, well thank you very much, and good luck in the new quarter and for the rest of the year."
Oscar Feldenkreis,1,"Thank you, Ron. Thank you for your support."
Operator,1,"Next from Sidoti & Company, we’ll hear from Greg Pendy. Please go ahead."
Greg Pendy,1,"Hey guys, thanks for taking my call. Just wanted to talk about the inventory. I know it’s only up 8% now, I guess, on a year-over-year basis, but is that mainly product shipping into Asia now on the Nike Swim, and how does that--is that going to normalize by the end of the year?"
Oscar Feldenkreis,1,"Hi Greg, good morning. The inventory is up on the areas that are showing growth, so it’s showing Perry Ellis portfolio bottoms, as I mentioned that grew in the quarter by plus-25% - you need to have inventory to fuel that growth, Nike domestic and international, as well as golf. We should see it much more normalized after we finish Q2, going into Q3, on the inventory side, which is what we said in Q4 when we announced our inventory was up, I think $25 million that we ended, so we’ve been very focused on managing the inventory, and we feel that by the end of Q2, going into Q3, we should be much more normalized going into the second half of the year."
Greg Pendy,1,"That’s very helpful. Thanks a lot, guys."
Oscar Feldenkreis,1,"Thank you, Greg. Appreciate it."
Operator,1,Next we’ll hear from Ed Yruma with Keybanc. 
Matt DeGulis,1,"Hi, thanks for taking our questions. This is Matt on for Ed. I have a couple questions on the golf business. It was a strong quarter, obviously, but I’m curious if you saw any weather impact in the quarter, maybe in swim as well. Just looking at the golf rounds played data, it seems like spring was down significantly across the midwest and northeast, so I guess your business did well this quarter but golf rounds played was down significantly. Is this like a relevant metric to track at all for your golf business? "
Oscar Feldenkreis,1,"Rounds of golf really doesn’t have a major impact on the golf lifestyle sportswear business, to be honest with you. It probably affects a little bit more of the country club, green grass distribution which there, you can find a little bit of softness; but remember, most of the golf courses which we’re open, which are in the southeast and west coast, are open all year round and they have actually done much better. We did not feel any impact in golf sportswear lifestyle due to rounds of golf, and today it’s more of a lifestyle approach and that’s how you are--that’s how we’re approaching the golf business. It’s all about performance wear, tops, bottoms, knits, etc., and that’s where the gentleman is buying his clothes."
Matt DeGulis,1,Okay.
Oscar Feldenkreis,1,"In terms of Nike Swim, Nike Swim was a little bit slower, especially in the east and the midwest in the beginning of the quarter, but things have picked up substantially and now that the weather has turned favorably throughout the country, our swim business is very, very positive."
Matt DeGulis,1,"Okay. Also on the international opportunity in golf, could you expand on that a bit, and for which brands do you have international licenses?"
Oscar Feldenkreis,1,"We have the Callaway, which I mentioned revenues in the quarter were up double digits. We started shipping Golf America, which is a retail store out of the U.K. under PGA Tour, which we do have the rights for and we continue to--we hopefully will be able to see growth in golf on the international side. We currently do deliver both Jack Nicklaus and PGA Tour in the western hemisphere, so we do have the rights for that area, plus as I mentioned before, we shipped Ben Hogan into the U.K., which we currently own, so we own international rights in Ben Hogan."
Matt DeGulis,1,Thanks.
Operator,1,"Next from DA Davidson, we have Michael Kawamoto. Please go ahead."
Michael Kawamoto,1,"Hey guys, congrats on a strong start to the year. "
Oscar Feldenkreis,1,"Thank you, Michael."
Michael Kawamoto,1,"Just on the guidance, does that original outlook include the $0.05 benefit from the retirement of the notes?"
Jorge Narino,1,"No, it did not; however, for purposes of this quarter, we’re still being cautiously optimistic and we are evaluating our business and seeing kind of where it’s going to lead. One of the other things that we are still looking at is our tax rate could fluctuate based on where our mix ends up, and which potentially foreign tax credits we’re able to utilize. We’re also contemplating whether or not we take some of that interest savings and reinvest it back into our business, so we’re kind of pursuing some of those avenues, so at this point we did not think that it warranted an increase to our EPS guidance related to the interest."
Michael Kawamoto,1,"Got it, that’s helpful. Did your gross margin outlook change at all?"
Jorge Narino,1,"No, we’re still planning to be at the 38.3% rate that we had said at the beginning of the year. "
Michael Kawamoto,1,"Got it. Then just to piggyback on international business, it sounds like Callaway and Nike were strong. It looks like you’ve signed a couple more licensing deals recently for your brands that extend them internationally - I think I saw Penguin in Mexico, I think Perry Ellis sunglasses in Korea. How do you view that international opportunity company-wide going forward, and where do you see that shaking out longer term? "
Oscar Feldenkreis,1,"Well, as the brands get stronger international and we continue to grow our wholesale and our direct to consumer business, that only allows the--that only increases the additional opportunities on the licensing side, and that’s why licensing for us is so important, because it rounds off the entire lifestyle and product categories that we do not offer on the wholesale side. "
Michael Kawamoto,1,"Awesome. Thanks for your time, and good luck for the rest of the year."
Oscar Feldenkreis,1,Thank you very much.
Operator,1,It appears there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.
Oscar Feldenkreis,1,"I want to thank you all very much for getting up early this morning and thank you all for your support. See you on Q2, thank you."
Operator,1,This concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.
