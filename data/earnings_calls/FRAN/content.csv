Steve Lawrence,0,"Thanks Kelly. Good morning everyone and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. During our call today, Kelly and I will give you some color around our first quarter performance, along with how we see second quarter playing out. 
Our top and bottom line results came in largely as expected. Overall, we saw sequential improvement in our comp performance, particularly in our non-apparel categories as our merchandizing initiatives began to take hold. While our comparable sales came in slightly below guidance, we saw trends improve across all categories as it got deeper into the quarter. Through the first 4 weeks of Q2, we've seen sales declines moderate from the results of Q1 illustrating an improving response to our assortments. 
Diving deeper into our first quarter results. Sales came in at $100 million, which was at the low end of our guidance where comparable store sales declined 16%, which was slightly outside of our guidance range of negative 13% to negative 15%. We met our total sales expectation while slightly missing on a comp sales basis as a result of the strength of the new boutiques that we've opened up over the past couple of quarters. We're pleased to see that our refined strategy of focusing primarily on A-rated centers as well as raising our internal profitability hurdle rates has elevated the performance in our new stores. 
In addition, the 15 boutiques we refreshed during the quarter are seeing a strong sales lift post remodel when you compare them against district, region, and total chain performance. Our bottom-line results came in at the better end of our guidance at a loss per share of $0.11. 
Merchandise margins remained pressured in the quarter coming in 220 basis points below last year as a result of continued liquidation of older products in our assortments. We believe that these markdowns were prudent and will help better position us to drive improved results throughout the remainder of 2018.
Our inventory on a per boutique basis ended the quarter down 5% versus the same time period last year. We were well positioned at the end of the quarter with inventories at healthy levels and the composition being much fresher. 
During the quarter, we saw improvement in several key financial metrics along with stronger trends in many of our merchandise categories. Both our shoes and accessories business ran positive comps for the quarter while we saw sequential improvement in our jewelry and gift categories with sales down in the mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. 
Our biggest challenge was the apparel category where sales remained sluggish throughout most of February and March. As more of our new assortment hit the sales floor and the temperatures around the country warmed up during the last couple of weeks of April, we did see improvement in our apparel sales. We have also seen conversion rates steadily improve and moderate during the first quarter averaging in the negative mid-single digits. 
As you may recall, in the back half of last year, conversion rates were down low teens on a year-over-year basis, suggesting our offering was not resonating with our customers. The improvement in trends we experienced in Q1 indicates to us that our guests are responding more favorably to our new assortments. 
Another positive sign is that as more of our new merchandises landed, we started to see sell-throughs on new product accelerate and get back to the rates that we achieved when the business was in a much healthier place. Clearly, the work the team has done around improved buy quantification and tighter inventory disciplines is starting to pay off. 
While we still have work to do, we believe that we are turning the corner and regaining some of our momentum. We expect comp sales in the second quarter to steadily improve versus our Q1 trend line and be in the negative 6% to negative 9% range. 
There are several catalysts that fall into place over the next quarter, which we expect will help deliver this improvement and set ourselves up to move back to positive comps in the second half of the year. 
The first point to note is that the momentum we started to see at the end of Q1 has carried in to May. The Motherâ€™s Day time period and the entire month of May were our strongest sales results last year. As I stated earlier, sales declines have moderated during the first four weeks of Q2, and we expect to see business continuing to improve over the next couple of months as we start to anniversary the tougher comps from last year. 
Another growth catalyst for us is our dotcom business. We have continued to experience double-digit comp increases in our online channel, and our expectation is to see acceleration here as we further improve and refine our assortments. Our newly launched omni-channel capabilities will be a key driver of growth during the remainder of 2018. We are still in the early innings of leveraging our buy online ship-to-boutique and buy-in-boutique ship-to-home capabilities, with both of these functionalities not coming online until fourth quarter of last year.
At this point, over 10% of our online shoppers are choosing to ship their dot-com orders to one of our physical locations, which is in turn turning into additional foot traffic. We are also seeing our boutique teams embrace the buy-in-boutique ship-to-home capability as a way to complete the outfit for a guest and build the sales check. This functionality has been particularly helpful in size-intensive businesses such as footwear, where we do not have a large presentation in store to carry an extended assortment online. 
As we get deeper into the quarter and start to set the floor for back-to-school, we believe that the assortment will be fully back on track and representative of our new vision for merchandising going forward. I'd like to take a moment to run you through all of the things that we have lined up for Q2 from an assortment perspective. 
First, the buying teams are firmly aligned behind our new edit point. This alignment will help drive much better cohesion and connectivity across categories and in the stories that we are telling. Back-to-school will be the first floor set where we conceptualize the assortment upfront and then connect it through to our website, all of our marketing efforts, and our in-boutique visual displays. The story we will be telling is called Canyon Rose and you will see this product featured prominently in our window displays, trend tables at front of each boutique, as well as in all of our marketing. 
Having a singular edit point has also given us a renewed focus on our target customer with a styling and fit that is more inclusive. In the past, many of our fits and stylings are too young or junior, while other styles were targeted at older demographics who required a different fit. Going forward, we will have much better consistency in our offering with the team focused on providing apparel that will appeal to women in her mid-20s and early 30s. 
We've also gone back to the drawing board in our clothing assortments and have added in better fabrics, special details and trims that all help improve the quality of our offering in these categories. We believe this increased quality, when coupled with our strong price points, will translate into outstanding value for our guests. 
Another opportunity for us is to develop better balance between our tops and our bottoms assortment. Team has worked hard on the launch of our new denim initiative, Harper Heritage, with special attention being paid to fit, finish, and trim details. This program launches with our back-to-school set and going forward, we see our tops to bottoms ratio moving from 4:1 to 3:1. 
Consistent with our strategy to position markdowns in the national selling season of the product, we plan to accelerate markdowns from third quarter and aggressively clear spring and summer products during Q2. These markdowns will have the added benefit of allowing to our new floor sets to cut through and help us head into the back-to-school season with inventories well positioned to react to selling. 
There will also be a return to our core mission of surprising and delighting our guests on each visit across all categories. In addition to the extensive work the team has done on apparel, look for updated more trend right offerings in key areas such as jewelry, gifts , handbags, and accessories. We believe that all the efforts we put into getting the assortment back on track will help us grow top-line sales by improving both conversion as well as units per transaction.
Another key focus for us is to ensure that our brick and mortar stores are engaging places for guests to shop. During the quarter we will refresh roughly 30 boutiques with our new format as well as open up an additional four stores. Between these boutiques and ones that we opened and remodeled earlier in the year, we should have over 10% of our fleet in a new updated format. It's important to note that we prioritize older, large-volume stores in high-profile locations to remodel first so the impact on sales and brand perception should be greater than the 10% would suggest. We believe this should also be another factor that will help fuel our turnaround. 
Finally, we're looking at our back-to-school floor set as an opportunity to relaunch our brand. One key catalyst to help convey the customers that there is something new and different to check out at Francesca's is rolling out our new loyalty program to the nation. The launch of Fran Rewards is slated to coincide with the timing of this floor set. We will kick off the program with our largest marketing spend of the year. And we will communicate it through all of our marketing channels with a heavy emphasis on social, digital and print. Program is structured to be gift focused, so as a thank you for joining Francesca or Fran Rewards, we will offer members a free gift during the launch period as well as an additional 10% discount. 
Moving forward, weâ€™ll offer members perks, such as free gifts on a quarterly basis, early access to promotions, a special discount around her birthday as well as member-only events. In the long-term we believe that the launch of Fran Rewards will help us increase engagement for our core customer and lead us to cash in a bigger share of her wallet. 
We are pleased to see that we are starting to regain some momentum in our business. There are a lot of catalysts for growth positioned in the second quarter that we believe could help deliver sequential improvement in our sales trend. As we turn in the corner in the second half of the year, all this work will position us to have the business inflect the positive comps. 
We have a strong team in place and we are all aligned in getting back to surprising and delighting our guests on a regular basis. 
Now, Iâ€™d like to turn it over to Kelly to walk you through a more detailed breakdown of our first quarter financials as well as second quarter guidance. Kelly?"
Kelly Dilts,0,"Thanks, Steve. I will begin with a review of our first quarter 2018 financial results followed by a discussion of our 2018 second quarter and full year guidance. 
Net sales for the first quarter decreased 7% to $100 million compared to $108 million in the same quarter last year. Comparable sales declined 16%, primarily due to a decrease in boutique traffic as well as the lower conversion rates. I would like to reiterate something Steve pointed out that while the conversion rate was lower than last year, it improved approximately 250 basis points from the fourth quarter. While the lower traffic may have been partially self-inflected, we believe the colder weather also contributed as we started to see traffic decline to moderate with the arrival of warmer weather in the last two weeks of April and continuing into May.
Importantly, the improved conversion rate is telling us that our merchandise assortment is beginning to resonate again with our guests. Average unit retail declined during the quarter with higher markdowns and promotions that was partially offset by an increase in units per transaction.
Additionally, sales from 65 net new boutiques opened since the first quarter of last year helped to offset the comp decline. We are very pleased to note that the new boutiques are performing better than expected. While last quarter we noted that comps declined across all categories with a few bright spots within each category, this quarter we had positive comps in both accessories and shoes. Additionally, both jewelry and gift comps improved sequentially from the fourth quarter.
Total gross margin for the first quarter decreased 700 basis points from last year to 38.2%. Breaking this down a bit further, occupancy cost de-leveraged 480 basis points and as expected, merchandise margin decreased 220 basis points from last year as we were appropriately aggressive in our markdown cadence to achieve the desired sell-throughs for the quarter.
Also, as expected, inventory per boutique decreased 5% on top of a decrease of 15% last year. On a two-year stack, this decline is in line with our comp sales two-year stack decline.
First quarter SG&A expenses increased $1.6 million or 4% compared to the prior year quarter. This increase was primarily due to increased selling expenses associated with the higher number of boutiques. SG&A was lower than expected, however, due to few favorable timing variances with future quarters. 
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 13.4% compared to 40.3% last year and included tax expense associated with the expiration of certain stock-based rewards. Excluding this expense, the effective tax rate was 22.1% which was lower than last year primarily due to the lower corporate income tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Diluted loss per share for first quarter was $0.11, this compares to earnings per share of $0.12 last year. 
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. We ended the current quarter with $21.8 million in cash compared to $48.1 million at the end of first quarter last year. As noted earlier, inventory decreased 5% on a per boutique basis and increased 4% in total. The company had no debt outstanding at the end of the quarter and did not borrow during the quarter. We did repurchase $3.5 million or 659,000 shares of our stock. As of today, we have $40.2 million remaining under our current repurchase program with the completion of this most recent purchase. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $8.7 million, we spent $5.8 million in new boutiques and $2.3 million on remodels in existing boutiques. The remaining CapEx was spent on IT and e-commerce projects. We also spent $0.6 million in system investments for our new warehouse management system, which is classified in other assets and amortized over the useful life of the software. This totals an investment of $9.3 million for the quarter and is on track with our plan. During the quarter, we opened 27 new boutiques and closed 4 bringing our total boutique count to 744. This consists of 350 mall locations and 394 non-mall locations including 91 outlets. We were able to open 2 stores earlier than planned. Additionally, we refreshed 15 boutiques and are on track to refresh 80 to 90 boutiques for the year. Our full year net new boutique guidance remains unchanged at 35 openings mostly in the first half of the year and 20 closures. 
I'd like to note that on May 25, we closed on our asset based revolving credit facility. Our previous $75 million facility was set to mature in August of this year. Our new line of credit is up to $50 million and is dependent on our borrowing-based formula primarily consisting of accounts receivable and inventory. 
As we noted on our last call, maintaining a conservative balance sheet is important to us. So, we will work towards building more cash on the balance sheet to compensate in the reduction of the revolver size. That said, when we believe we have excess cash, we will evaluate the best use of that cash considering both long term growth investments and returning cash to shareholders through repurchases. 
Now let's move on to our second quarter guidance. We expect net sales of $119 million to $122 million, a decrease of 1% to an increase of 2% compared to last year. We expect to open 4 new boutiques during the quarter and close approximately 8. We also expect a comparable sales decrease of 6% to 9%. This is a significant sequential improvement from the first quarter. We believe we are on the right track with the first month of the quarter under our belt. As Steve noted, we saw an improvement in May comp sales decline and this was up against our last year's positive comp of plus 3%. June and July year-over-year comparisons are easier. 
Total gross margin is expected to decrease significantly compared to last year, as occupancy de-leverages substantially and merchandise margins decrease by approximately 300 basis points. This decrease is related to more aggressive markdowns, as we stayed disciplined in clearing products end season. 
Additionally, as Steve noted, we are also accelerating markdowns compared to last year to clear slower selling styles and ensure the new product shines through for the important back-to-school season. We expect in the second quarter with inventory per boutique down in the low teen range leaving us the opportunity to react to sales trend. 
Second quarter SG&A is expected to increase approximately $4 million compared to last year. The increase is due to higher payroll and incentive-based compensation, higher software service, professional fees and depreciation expense associated with both current year and last year investments, increased marketing associated with the launch of our loyalty program and back-to-school selling season, and finally, selling costs associated with new boutiques. 
The tax rate for the second quarter is expected to be 24.2% and we expect 34.8 million diluted shares. Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter is expected to be in the range of $0.02 to $0.05.
Our full year 2018 sales and EPS guidance remain unchanged. We expect total sales of $485 million to $499 million with comparable sales declines in the low single-digits and 15 net new boutiques. This guidance implies that the back half has a positive comp sale of approximately plus 4% to plus 9%. While these results are a significant improvement from our second quarter guidance, we believe we will be positioned to achieve positive comps both an assortment perspective and a marketing perspective specifically with the loyalty launch. 
Additionally, it also seems reasonable when you consider the two-year comp sales stack is in the range of an 8% to 13% decline, which is relatively in line with our second quarter guidance that has a two-year comp sales stack range of negative 9% to negative 12%. 
Diluted earnings per share is expected to be $0.53 to $0.53 for fiscal year 2018 compared to 2017â€™s GAAP EPS of $0.43 and adjusted EPS of $0.52. Last yearâ€™s adjusted EPS excludes $3.3 million or $0.09 per diluted share and charges related to the re-measurement of deferred tax assets associated with the new tax law.
Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be $30 million including approximately $22 million for the 80 to 90 refreshes and 35 new boutiques. The remainder will be spent on our new warehouse management system, loyalty program and other technology and corporate investments that support improved short-term performance and long-term growth. 
This concludes the financial review and weâ€™d now like to open up the call for questions. Operator?"
Operator,1,[Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Randy Konik with Jefferies.
Randy Konik ,1,"Hey quick -- just quick one on the clarification on the apparel comps. So, I think you said last quarter the -- all the category comps were negative, this quarter you cited some positives in footwear and accessories, which is very comforting. The apparel comp is still negative, so that means that the apparel business this quarter was below I guess the total company comp in the quarter. Can you give us some perspective on how much of that comp you think was driven by weather in the quarter? And just to give us some more perspective on that improved conversion trend line because it looks like it improved nicely on a sequential basis towards the end of the quarter. Are you starting to see that further improve into the current quarter or just curious on how you're seeing that? And is that a function of your better apparel assortments improving that total conversion line. Thanks."
Steve Lawrence ,1,"So, Iâ€™ll take a stab at answering that Randy, there is couple of questions wrapped up in there. I definitely believe that there was some impact to the apparel business based off of weather. We try not to lean too hard into that. I know there has been various reports out there with weather impact on business in Q1. But clearly you could see it in the seasonal categories. We did definitely see the apparel trends pick up as we got deeper into that April time period and the weather warmed up. A lot of the seasonal categories tops and shorts really kicked in so that was encouraging. And we do believe that the improvement in apparel trend line is helping the conversion improvement that we have seen start in Q1 and continue into Q2. So, it's early days -- we're taking that as the assortments really starting to resonate, and what's really encouraging is when you look at the newest receipts we land, each month we land new receipts actually every week. But as we kind of look at them on a monthly basis, the sell-throughs have gone, have increased on a weekly basis, the newer the product. So it just reinforces to us guests really, really have a voracious appetite for new product. And as new product has been landing, it is getting higher and higher rates of acceptance based off the sell-throughs. So, we believe that will continue as we progress through second quarter and get closer to back-to-school. "
Randal Konik,1,"And then just on the annual outlook, is there kind of some perspective on how we should be thinking about gross margin versus SG&A? And just thinking about where normalized gross margin should be? Let's assume that if the comp started to turn and stay turned and then the inventories are down on a per boutique basis and then we assume that conversion continues to get better which would imply markdowns go down and merchandize margins improve. How should we be thinking about like back half split between gross margin and SG&A? And then longer term what's kind of more of a normalized level of gross margin for this business to be? Thanks, guys. "
Kelly Dilts,1,"Yeah. So, I would say gross margin in the back half, it should definitely improve. So, the merchandise margin piece will come in favorably compared to last year as we are working through all that product to clear through, we took some pretty heavy markdowns. So, it will be up against some easier comparisons from a merchandise margin perspective. We've also done a lot of work just around averaging at cost and averaging at retail correlation, so we feel like we're in a good shape there. 
From an occupancy perspective, we're probably still going to deleverage just a little bit. For the full year, we see occupancy deleveraging probably mostly offsetting the higher merchandize margins overall for the year. So net, net, gross margin should be about flattish for the full year. What is the new normal for gross margin, I think we'll have a better handle on that when we guide towards 2019, and we can understand a little bit more about how our new inventory flow process is working. We should definitely have lower markdowns and lower MOS going into 2019 as we land that product â€“ those receipts weekly. SG&A is about -- from a guidance perspective, is about the same as the last call. We're expecting mid-to-high, single-digit increase for the full year. "
Randy Konik,1,"Understood. And I guess last question, back to Steve. You gave a lot of color on a lot of different processes, procedures and items that have been going on in the business. Are we getting towards like getting all those kind of taking care of, you feel good about, the company moving forward from here and then the products basically getting to a place where it needs to be and starting to kind of show some traction? I guess what Iâ€™m trying to figure out is, do you feel comfortable that youâ€™ve reached kind of the fundamental kind of bottom or trough in the business and the processes and procedures that need to be changed are basically changed at this point or near close to being done from your view?"
Steve Lawrence,1,"I would say Randy, there is always work to be done but yes, I think a lot of the work that we have been talking to you guys about over the past couple of quarters, I feel like we're getting those things kind of locked down. The floor discipline that weâ€™ve put in place has really been working for us and I think weâ€™ll start yielding better sales results as the customers gets used to us being back to the idea of she better buy today because it won't be here tomorrow, and weâ€™re starting to see that happen. We have positioned the markdowns more appropriately by quarter now with this last move, moving some markdowns from Q3 into Q2 to really clear the spring-summer product in advance of the back-to-school sets so that, that product really shines through. So, I think kind of the shape of how we see the quarters winding up is going to start to stabilize and I think weâ€™re really, hopefully starting to inflect that. I mean what weâ€™ve guided is we think once we get through this quarter and get back into Q3, Q4, we see comps infecting back to positive. So, I would say yes, we see the turning point in the business happening in Q2."
Operator,1,And we will take our next question from Susan Anderson with B. Riley FBR.
Susan Anderson ,1,"I guess just to dig in a little bit further on apparel within the quarter, did you guys see any areas of outperformance within products such as like dresses or bottoms? And then I think you talked about increasing the penetration of bottoms, so does that mean that the dress penetration will also go down. I think you talked about tops going down? And then also you talked about adding more quality and detail, is that going to prove out the price points on the product?"
Steve Lawrence,1,"So, a couple of things wrapped up in that question. Certainly, we saw dress business percolate around a time period when it was really a dress centric time period. As we got past Easter, the dress business softened a little bit. And in dresses, thereâ€™s some trends that are emerging where itâ€™s less what is considered a traditional dress, more jumpsuits, more rompers, are really kind of the trend there. And weâ€™re certainly seeing large gains in those categories. But we are definitely seeing a slight decline in the dress business and the business moving more to separates. 
We traditionally have been very top-centric and really havenâ€™t had much of a bottoms business, which I think hasnâ€™t played in our favor whenever we see dress business in a little bit of a decline. So, to fight that, what weâ€™ve done is weâ€™re taking a stronger stance on bottoms which I mentioned on the call and really the first big push on that for us will be a much larger denim footprint on our floors as we go into the back-to-school time period with the re-launch of our Harper Heritage. Thatâ€™s a great example of a place where weâ€™re adding some quality and we are seeing the tickets and AURs go up slightly. So, a pair of Harper Heritage jeans last year or Harper jeans last year would have been around $44, this year itâ€™s going to be ticketed around $48. But what I would tell you is in both cases with the modest discounting that we do is above $50, both are designed to out the door under $40. So, we still think we're hitting a really strong price point, but we're getting really compelling value. The team has done a lot of work on, is it the right zipper, the right pocket bags, the right way to fabrication, the level of destruction on the jeans. We're just offering a much higher quality product in the apparel assortments going forward. And that translates beyond just denim and to tops in to everything that we're doing. "
Susan Anderson,1,"Hey that's helpful. And then one follow up on the new on the store refreshes. I think you talked about last quarter maybe moving some categories around within the store. Maybe if you could just give an update on some of that testing going on and see if you have seen any impact, that will be helpful. Thanks. "
Steve Lawrence,1,"Yeah. So, what you're referencing is we've mentioned that we've remerchandised the boutique with our spring set. And actually, we're very pleased with the results of that. What we felt was when we started taking a critical eye to how we merchandise boutique, maybe gotten a little too formulae. Same categories were always in the same positions. So, we said let's remerchandise this to create more interest throughout the boutique. So, what you may have noticed is that the jewelry business, we moved those tables, which traditionally have been at the front entrance kind of in the midpoint of the store right near the cash wrap. We actually think that's benefited the jewelry business candidly because what we also did is we [indiscernible] the table so that you can shop more of the surface there. And the team is really is part of the jewelry business, we think that was a win. 
We fold one of the cabinets that we traditionally have merchandised categories right next to cash wrap and put shoes in there so that the guests can see all the different shoes that we carry in the assortment we have seen at a resurgence in our shoe business. We think based off of that. We took our handbag cabinet and we're in the passage, it was just kind of a wall of washed PU handbags and we've integrated different home and gift categories into there. We feel like that's been much more interesting. And where we've done we have seen more productivity out of that fixture points. We think that was a win. And really the thing we also did was created a trend table at the front of each boutique, where we're pulling together our stories. And I will say that those tables are some of the fastest trend fixtures in the store. And the teams are constantly replenishing those fixtures. We think that was a big win as well. So good learnings there. We're going to continue to refine those strategies as we remerchandise the store for back-to-school. And you'll see us do this about 4 or 5 times a year as we have major floor steps. We're going to kind of change it up, make it a little different. And just really make it more interesting. But we feel like that was a really good strategy for us. "
Susan Anderson,1,"Great, that sounds good. And on the shoes, you talked about also having kind of an extended aisle there with more offerings online. Do you think that helped the shoes to comp positive in the quarter or was it also just kind of the repositioning of shoes within the stores?"
Steve Lawrence ,1,"I think it's a combination of both. I mean I think shoes as you know in the past was sort of an afterthought in terms of how we merchandised it. There were merchandise underneath all the clothing runs. And so, in a lot of cases people didnâ€™t even know we carried footwear if they didn't look down and see them down there. So, I think the awareness and visibility of the stores helped. And clearly the omnichannel capabilities there are also helped. We have the extent of assortment online. And candidly we didn't do a lot in the quarter to change the kind of the character of footwear. But we've got a lot of really exciting things we're doing there as we kind of bring footwear along with the rest of the assortment that going forward, you'll see a probably revitalize footwear assortment which we're very excited about as well. "
Susan Anderson,1,Thanks so much. Good luck next quarter. 
Steve Lawrence ,1,Thank you. 
Operator,1,And we'll take our next question from Janet Kloppenburg with JJK Research. 
Janet Kloppenburg ,1,"Good morning everyone. I wanted to talk a little bit more about the investment in bottoms versus tops and the dresses. How are you making that decision about allocation and what kind of confidence do you have that youâ€™ve got -- youâ€™ll have the right balance as we move into the fall season? It is a change for you to be concentrating more on bottoms and Iâ€™d love to hear some thoughts there. Also, if you could give us perspective on what youâ€™re expecting for apparel comps in the back half, you are looking for I think you said Kelly, positive comps, but are you looking for apparel to turn on in the back half or would that be a slow return or inflection expected in that category? And maybe you could talk a little bit about accessories as well? Thanks. "
Steve Lawrence,1,"So, Janet, Iâ€™ll take a stab at answering some of them and then Kelly can jump in where -- maybe in the next point So clearly, as you noted, we have not had strength in bottoms. So, we know that we needed to start building that. We started with denim which is obviously the most universal bottom thatâ€™s out there and thereâ€™s certainly a denim trend happening out there. So, the team really worked hard to engineering to come up with a denim program weâ€™d be proud of, which is why we mentioned on the call Harper Heritage. This is not going to be a revolution, itâ€™s an evolution. So, to move strategically from a mix of 4 to 1 top to bottom to 3 to 1 I think is a step in the right direction, itâ€™s not like weâ€™re trying to go from 4 to 1 to 2 to 1 or a 1 to 1 ratio. So, it will more than double our denim penetration but itâ€™s a pretty small category for us. So thatâ€™s how we thought of it. There is a range of fits and finishes and depending upon the size of the boutique and the penetration in bottoms, they may get more fits and finishes versus a smaller boutique which will get a smaller assortment. We certainly have carved out the footprint floor within the boutiques. So, we feel like weâ€™ve got it accounted for. We'll call audibles as we go, if we get good reaction and it could be a bigger percentage of our business, weâ€™ll grow it. And if it doesnâ€™t hit our expectations, weâ€™ll tweak and try to figure out what weâ€™re missing. But we feel really good about the initial efforts the team's put on the table there. "
Kelly Dilts,1,"Yes, and I would just add, in order to get the plus 4 to plus 9 we do need apparel to inflect. And thatâ€™s what weâ€™ll be looking for in the back half."
Janet Kloppenburg ,1,"And the accessories, whatâ€™s going on with the handbag business and what you see there, I know thatâ€™s been challenging?"
Steve Lawrence,1,"Itâ€™s actually been a bright spot for us. Thereâ€™s definitely -- thereâ€™s been a lot of fun things happening in handbags. We -- our handbag assortment has been pretty stagnant and the team has really gone out and reinvented that thing. I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve been at our boutiques recently. But thereâ€™s a huge play on seasonal handbag there in linens and rattans and wicker, and fun shapes like the canteen bags. And as weâ€™ve really gotten into those, weâ€™ve seen the handbags resurge. And I would also say itâ€™s a combination of remerchandising and employing some other categories in there with the kind of the sea of brown and black leather or PU and it really wasnâ€™t interesting so I think the combination of some new bags, fabrics and silhouettes, coupled with remerchandising some of the categories does really breathe some life into that category. We are pretty excited about it."
Kelly Dilts,1,"Yes, in fact on our e-commerce buy, weâ€™ve seen several of those handbags sell out. "
Janet Kloppenburg,1,Okay. And you feel good about that category for fall?
Steve Lawrence,1,"Yes, we do. We are pretty excited about it. The team is doing a really, really good job there."
Janet Kloppenburg,1,"Okay. Should we expect inventory levels to be about the same in the back half, down this mid-single-digit level? Or given the extent of the margin markdowns it appears youâ€™ll be taking in second quarter; will they be leaner? How should we be thinking about that?"
Kelly Dilts,1,"Yes, at the end of second quarter, I expect them to be down in the low teens. So, we should have a lot of opportunity to react when we need to. For the full year the original guidance was down low single digits, but if we can improve that we will. "
Steve Lawrence ,1,"Yeah, I think you'll see inventories lower [indiscernible] basis throughout all of fall. We haven't determined the correct level yet of what exactly that looks like. But if you remember last year, we came in with inventories pretty closely aligned to the prior year going in to back-to-school and then obviously the business was really tough the customer voted no on the assortment, and we really got on defense and inventories started to back up. And then of course, we had the hurricane, which really inhibited our ability to flow merchandise. So, I think you're going to see us stay really lean and really embrace the flow this once we put in place -- constantly be getting newness out there. So, I think you'll see leaner inventories throughout the whole back half and much better flow all the way through. "
Janet Kloppenburg ,1,Okay. And just lastly on the new apparel product. Have you done a lot of testing and for the fall season? And you feel confident about the apparel assortments checking better than they have been in the first half?
Steve Lawrence ,1,"Sure. I mean a lot of the testing has been real time testing of silhouettes that can translate into fall right now. We do feel better a much better about the apparel coming forward. It's on point, it's value packed, it's got great detail, it's not too trendy on the foot side, it's just trend right. So, we feel like we're getting the sweet spot with the assortment going forward. The team is pretty excited about it. "
Kelly Dilts,1,"And one good thing that we're seeing that is kind of lacking is employee sales as well. And so, we have seen employee sales of our apparel products increased pretty significant this last round. So that was good to see. "
Steve Lawrence ,1,Janet you've been with the store for a long time. It used to be that behavior that when the box would come in that everybody gather around and wait to see what was in it and associates could be buying some of the best pieces right away. I think that has been happening throughout the most of last year and we're starting to hear that happening now. So that's another indication that we feel like we're on the right track. 
Janet Kloppenburg ,1,Best of luck to you guys. Thanks. 
Steve Lawrence ,1,Thanks.
