Alain Weill,0,
"Thank you, Vincent, and welcome to Altice Europe. Hello, everyone. On Slide 3, we outlined our core strategy for Altice Europe. Firstly, over the last year, we have intensified our focus on improving customer experience, and we are continuing to make significant progress. We are already seeing significant benefit from these changes, effective in our record subscriber momentum, as I will explain in the following slides. Secondly, we continue to invest in our proprietary best-in-class infrastructure, both in fiber and mobile, commensurate with Altice Europe's position as a number one of two operator in each market.",0,"Finally, we are accelerating the monetization of our content investments through various Pay TV models, and we are growing advertising revenue further. This strategy is paying off, as you can see, in our record subscriber numbers as well as in our competitors' behavior. This strategy will, in the coming quarters, enable Altice to return to revenue growth, profitability expansion and cash flow generation.
Slide 4 sets out our key takeaways for the third quarter. Our differentiated strategy focused on investment in proprietary infrastructure and premium and key content continues paying off as we are seeing very strong subscriber pickup in our main geographies.
Our operational turnaround is on track. In both France and Portugal, further significant improvement has been achieved since the beginning of the year. In France B2C, we upraised more than 1 million subscribers since January 2018 compensating the loss of subscribers over the last three years since the SFR acquisition. We now have more than 21 million subscribers in Portugal.
In Portugal, the year-over-year growth of our subscriber base is now accelerating in both fixed and mobile and we are proven over the last 12 months that MEO is no longer announcing fixed and mobile postpaid subscriber. In France, we signed new agreement to expand our fiber footprint in both the medium-dense and low-dense areas, expanding our addressable market for high-speed broadband services and putting us in an ideal position to be a significant participant with the appealing infrastructure wholesale market.
We accelerated in Q3 2018 the monetization of our unique content assets, notably the Champions League, so built this offer with our telco arm SFR contributing to better gross ads and up-selling existing customer orders with also reducing churn, OTT offer with high partners, and low variable costs as well as a new wholesale agreement with Canal+ for its satellite clients only.
Last, but not least, we have made a real progress in strengthening our balance sheet. We have successfully co-financed part of our debt in France in July. We have delivered on the execution of our noncore asset disposable program with notably the closing of the 12 of mobile stores in Portugal and in Dominican Republic. The sale of a part of our French mobile store to KKR is expected to occur by the end of this year. These steps are presented in the client selling of our long-term balance sheet position, while crusading the underlying value of Altice Europe notably its infrastructure.
On Slide 5, you can see a summary of the main trends in B2C for France and Portugal. In France, these KPIs highlight stabilizing trends despite tight competition. In Portugal, these KPIs highlight stronger trends, and we target to be back in growth in the coming quarters. In France, our subscriber momentum continues to be strong with 166,000 net additions in fixed, of which 64,000 net additions in fiber and 368,000 net additions in mobile. SFR has been, by far, the outperformer in the third quarter notably in mobile postpaid, where we have had a record quarter since 2004.
We continue to successfully and meaningfully reduce churn compared to the last year with the improvement of operating processes and better retention. So year-on-year comparison for ARPU remains challenging, especially due to the variability we have had last year, but with – we see signs of stabilization quarter-over-quarter in both fixed and mobile is clear when it is compared to the recent quarter. In Portugal, net adds continue to improve and ARPU are stabilizing, rising second shift increase in revenues for both fixed and mobile. We are extremely pleased with our performance in Portugal.
Based on Portuguese regulator and regulator and account statistics, MEO is now the leader on all six packages, including for triple play, and we keep improving our market share. From an operational perspective, Portugal remains our best-in-class asset in churn, with churn rate below 10% in both fixed and mobile postpaid.
Slide 6 shows an overview of our very high speed bundle household infrastructure in France, Portugal and Israel. We are the market leader and have a competitive advantage in each geography after years of sustained investment. For France, I would like to state that most of our infrastructure is owned, which is not the case for most of our competitors, as you can see on the left-hand side of the slide. We would like our capacity to invest and the structural difference in cash flow generation in the market. There is much value in such proprietary infrastructure.
Consistent with this, we will continue to invest where it makes sense and, in particular, new fiber on pace in French mid- and low-dense areas where we secured the right to build and operate the fiber infrastructure in approximately 20% of this territory.
On Slide 7, you can see an update on the execution of our plan to strengthen our balance sheet. First of all, we have signed the tower of disposals in France, Portugal and Dominican Republic. We have already closed Portugal and the Dominican Republic, and we expect to close France in the coming weeks. This transaction represent total sales proceeds of more than EUR 2.5 billion. Altice will retain the controlling 50% stake in the French tower portfolio as well as a substantial interest in the Portuguese portfolio.
Secondly, we have started to see significant increase of content collected revenue, namely monetization of the Champions League rights. We have customer on top of new OTT clients and SFR clients seeking content vendor. RMC Sport is now already to reach the level of 2 million of customers. Thirdly, we continue to strengthen further our long-term balance sheet position, while crusading the underlying value of Altice Europe by reducing our fixed infrastructure in France as well as our other region. We have made very good progress in France. And as was said, many offers from very high-quality partners to accelerate FTTH infrastructure deployment. As of to date, we have not yet taken any final decision
I will now hand over to Malo, our new CFO, and I congrats Malo to take you through the Altice Europe business for you."
Malo Corbin,0,"Thank you, Alain. It’s a pleasure for me after several years working with Altice, Patrick, Dexter, Dennis and the team to take this role, and I’m looking forward to spend more time engaging with investors and analysts.
Moving to Slide 9., we show SFR B2C subscriber trends. We are number one, again, this quarter in subscriber recruitment. Year-to-date, we have won back more than 1 million customer equivalent to the amount of customer we lost over the last three years since the SFR acquisition. On the left-hand side of the slide, you can see the B2C fixed net adds where we added 64,000 fiber customer in the third first quarter with 40% of our fixed B2C base now in fiber.
We achieved a strong performance in the competitive market with positive total fixed net adds for the third quarter in a row. Adding our new OTT RMC Sport subscribers, we acquired 166,000 net adds in Q3 2018. On the right-hand side of the slide, you can see the B2C mobile postpaid net adds. Q3 was the eighth consecutive quarter of growth since we upgraded the mobile network and expanded the 4G coverage. We added an impressive 278,000 new postpaid customers this quarter and more than 800,000 year-to-date.
The SFR brand was net adds-positive this quarter, as it was the case in the previous quarter. In both our fixed and mobile segments, the improved performance was largely driven by substantial improvement in churn following operational changes achieved by the management team in France. In addition, we benefited from the positive impact linked to RMC Sports and its premium Champions League content, which started mid-September. These trends continued so far in Q4 2018 with a lower level of competition. Total B2C fixed ARPU and mobile postpaid ARPU declines are moderating. In Q3, both declined 1% quarter-over-quarter.
Slide 10. Improving customer service is core to our strategy, and we are seeing ongoing improvements. For example, we continue to make progress in improving installation processes and increasing network automation to the effect and solve issues more quickly. We remain very focused on other metrics that are central to the customer experience. As you can see on this slide, fixed customer complaints have reduced by 37% this quarter compared to last year, and the same story is also true on the mobile side where complaints have been halved versus last year. As a result of this, technical service calls have significantly reduced.
All of these processes that we are very focused on are directly correlated to our churn, and we are confident that we’ll continue to improve our customer satisfaction, reducing churn and also reducing the associated costs. We have further room to improve here as we open new areas to FTTH in 2019, where we currently operate the DSL against competitors’ FTTH.
On Slide 11, we want to highlight our flexibility to address both the low-end and digital market as well as the high-end and non-digital market. The competitive intensity of the French market during Q3 was even greater than in Q2. As it has been the strategy for the last 12 months, SFR remains a follower in promotions, counterattacking promotions of peers when it makes sense. The chart on the left highlights how we can be agile in order to achieve our per share of net adds, despite the promotional episodes.
In this context, our digital no-frill brand RED had excellent commercial traction despite no discount versus competition and even higher prices. RED customer come with an ARPU slightly below total mobile blended ARPU, but more importantly with lower associated costs and reduced churn. In the high end of the market, SFR benefits from its market-leading distribution network being number one in number of shops with high-quality infrastructure with a greater number of project sites and its unique content portfolio, both with an exclusive offering and with a full sports suite offering.
The SFR brand customer base grew again in the third quarter 2018. We remain very pleased with the complementary of our RED brand and our SFR brand, both of them delivering positive net adds this quarter, together with the second quarter, this is the first time for SFR brand since 2014.
Moving to Slide 12. We announced the group has undertaken a strategic review of its fiber infrastructure to further accelerate its deployment and is exploring financial partnerships. Let’s focus on our fiber project in France. Over the recent quarters, we have seen an acceleration of cyber adoption in France, notably driven by high bandwidth usage, and more importantly increasing number of singleton use users within the same household. All retail operators have clear ambition in fiber. In the mid- and low-dense area in particular, cyber pickup is also supported by a low quality of the DSL network.
The existing regulatory framework in France in the mid- and low-dense areas enabled the cyber infrastructure operator to reach full penetration on its infrastructure. In those areas, Altice France has secured approximately 5 million homes, of which approximately 1 million homes have already been built today. We are exploring partnerships with financial investor to accelerate the rollout of the remaining homes, while optimizing the financing of this rollout. And as mentioned by Alain, we are extending this review to our fixed infrastructure to other countries of Altice Europe.
Slide 13 shows the component of Altice France revenue trends. Total revenue declined 5.5% excluding the VAT benefit. And as you remember, we’re still benefiting from more favorable VAT treatment for some of the present key bundles in March earlier this year, with the full year annualized impact of EUR 240 million across the fixed and mobile, of which EUR 200 million this year. B2C revenue declined 6.4% impacted by retention activity initiated in the first quarter of 2018 and the continued fierce market competition. ARPU declines are moderating year-on-year and are stabilizing quarter-over-quarter. It is also worth highlighting, following substantial reduction in churn, that our top line is also negatively impacted by reduction in disconnecting fees.
Turning to the B2B trends. The top line decline was 4.4% year-on-year, still an improvement in the year-on-year trend versus Q2, which was down 5.5% year-over-year. Mobile revenue is still decreasing because of the development of flat rate offers, including roaming and impacting ARPU. We are currently reorganizing the B2B customer service, especially creating dedicated department for large accounts with new sales representatives.
Sequential development in Q3 2018 is negatively impacted by the usual entry-level similarity in Q3, where sale benefits from increasing contribution from major MVNO player, such as La Poste and EI Telecom.
Finally, other revenues are impacted by revenue decline in our French overseas territory assets and the gross at NextRadioTV is offset by the declining trend of the press activity leading to flat revenue year-over-year for our media division. From a sequential and a seasonality point of view, media is always at a low point in the third quarter.
Now moving to Portugal on Slide 14. We show here the B2C subscriber trends for Altice Portugal. Our strategy is paying off, and we plan to be back to revenue growth in the coming quarters in Portugal, supported by continued strong commercial momentum. MEO achieved a solid gain of 44,000 fiber net adds in the third quarter with more than 25% of our fixed base now on fiber.
MEO grew its total fixed base for the fourth consecutive quarter, adding 8,000 customers versus customer receipts of 11,000 last year, and with a strong performance in the Pay-TV segment, where MEO captured more than 60% of the total market growth for the fourth consecutive quarter.
MEO pursued a strong in mobile too, adding 37,000 net adds in the third quarter to its postpaid customer base, more than twice the level of addition we had the same quarter last year. These operational results are the consequence of higher gross adds and lower churn, with churn in Portugal reaching historical low levels. And this has been achieved with a successful fiber rollout strategy, our new commercial strategy and improving the quality of our customer service.
Slide 15 shows the components of Altice Portugal's revenue trends. Total Altice Portugal revenue continued to show a steady improvement, with a 0.3% decline year-over-year in Q3 versus minus 5.4% year-over-year in Q2 2018. Revenue continued to grow sequentially, plus 1.8% quarter-over-quarter.
Total B2C revenue grew quarter-over-quarter for the second quarter in a row, the first time in near two years by plus 1.2% with a more modest decline of 1.8% year-over-year versus a decline of 4.4% the last quarter – the previous quarter. Year-over-year, trends are still impacted by ARPU pressure, which reflects the regulatory decision in Q3 2017 to open up MEO's customer base for disconnections, which required an increased retention activity as well as the absence of an across-the-board price increase in 2018.
Note that mobile ARPU is stable quarter-over-quarter in Q3 2018. And our focus remains on sustaining of subscriber momentum, continuing to grow both in fixed and in mobile. B2B revenue declines are also moderating year-over-year in Q3 2018 with minus 0.7% in Q3 2018 versus minus 2% in Q2.
Our business is still impacted by the continued repricing of our legacy services, but we benefit from stronger growth in new revenue stream, such as ICT. Both fixed and mobile net additions in B2B were the highest in more than three years this quarter. The sequential decrease, of course, of the B2B is also linked to usual seasonality of the third quarter.
Now moving to the financial. On Slide 17, you can see the pro forma consolidated financials for Altice Europe N.V. based on the new parameter post split for Altice Europe and under the IFRS 15 new accounting standard. For the third quarter of 2018, total group revenue of EUR 2.4 billion were down 6.1% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis.
Group adjusted EBITDA decreased to EUR 1.3 billion, down 10.4% on a constant-currency basis and minus 6.8%, excluding the loss of the VAT benefit in France, which is about EUR 60 million third quarter.
Altice France EBITDA declined by 12% impacted by the loss of the VAT benefit, as I just mentioned. Excluding that impact, France EBITDA was down 7.1% impacted by upward version due to fierce competition and promotions and higher subscriber acquisition costs driven by the commercial momentum. We put a strong focus at maintaining a tight control and streamlining our cost base, such as, for example, the success of the digital customer service with the RED offer.
In Portugal, EBITDA declined 5.2% compared to last year, reflecting gross margin erosion in the B2B segment, B2C ARPU year-on-year comparison and the tower disposal impact about EUR 3 million this quarter, which has not been restated in this number. In Israel, EBITDA declined 13.8% year-over-year on a constant currency basis due to the intensification of the competition.
Group operating free cash flow is impacted in the third quarter of 2018 by accrued CapEx of EUR 1.013 billion related to the CapEx linked to the Champions League over the three coming years. Excluding this non-cash one-off, our operating free cash flow in Q3 2018 would have been close to EUR 590 million.
We reiterate our fiscal 2018 guidance. Altice France is still expected to generate operating free cash flow of EUR 1.5 billion to EUR 1.6 billion range, and Altice Europe is expected to generate an operating free cash flow of EUR 2.3 billion to EUR 2.5 billion, excluding the Altice TV segment.
Recall, that considering our current very strong commercial momentum, we are generating higher acquisition costs and client CapEx to the benefit of future growth.
And I will now hand over to Dennis to take you through the capital structure and debt pages."
Dennis Okhuijsen,0,"Thank you, Malo, and congratulations, again, for your promotion to CFO. From my side, I remain fully committed to Altice Europe and continue to have a particular focus on capital structure and strategy going forward.
Slide 18 provides an overview of the European pro forma capital structure, including the separate Altice France, Altice International silos, the Altice LuxCo, Altice Corporate Financing and the separate Altice TV silo. Pro forma the reorganization and signed M&A transactions, including the proceeds from the tower sales, Altice Europe net debt position was just under EUR 30 billion at the end of the quarter with a pro forma leverage of 5.6x on the last 12-month EBITDA.
Deleveraging remains our top priority with our confidence in growth for 2019 and no new one-off cash flow items in the horizon, we will further deleverage toward our target of 4 times to 4.5 times. Also, the infrastructure projects under review will have a significant deleveraging effect.
Slide 19 sets out the maturity profile for Altice Europe as of the third quarter. Following our successful refinancing at Altice France, there are now no major maturities in France till 2024. At Altice International, there are no major maturities until 2023. We are confident to extend the maturity of our holdco notes that are due in 2022 in 2019 after the conclusion of our infrastructure projects that are currently under review and on the back of a growing European telco business. In addition, our liquidity remained strong at EUR 4.6 billion, a weighted average life of debt is over six years and our average cost is 5.7% and 85% of our debt remains fixed.
And with that, Patrick, Alain, Malo and myself are happy to welcome any questions."
Operator,1,[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Daniel Morris of Barclays. Your line is open.
Daniel Morris,1,"Yes, good evening and thanks for taking the question. My question is just on the time line for your French JV process on the fiber side. I just wonder do you expect to conclude that by the year-end? And then also related to that, can you give us some thoughts on whether Portugal is more interesting to potential partners than Israel and Dominican Republic given it's a fiber footprint or they all assets that you think there is third party interest? Malo Corbin"
Malo Corbin,1,"Yes, thank you. So I think on your question on the French process, so as we are explaining, so we are focusing here on the fiber in the mid- and low-dense area with the objective to accelerate the growth of the fiber to get a greater share of the market wholesale market over there, plus I think this project has an objective to improve the financing of this rollout because as I was explaining, we have secured 5 million homes and we have already built 1 million, so we still have 4 million homes to be built.
Now on the process, it's a competitive process with various financial partner. So we don't want to disclose any detailed information at this stage, but we are very happy with where we are, and we are seeing strong interest for fiber. Now moving to Portugal and Israel, I think, we are taking this project one-by-one, so we are very well advanced with the French project, and we are now starting looking at Israel and Portugal and we'll come back to you later when we'll have more information to share on those projects."
Daniel Morris,1,Thanks for taking the question.
Operator,1,Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lee of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Andrew Lee,1,"Thank you. I just had a question on your confidence in French financials improving. So obviously, KPIs have been strong over the last couple of quarters. I wonder if you could talk through why you're so confident in the financials improving into 2019 given it clearly remains a tough market environment, which all your competitors are struggling to deliver growth? Would you expect on a like-for-like basis to be delivering more growth than the market average in 2019? And what are the kind of – what are the risk factors for that? And then just a second – just a follow-up question on the previous question on the French fiber stake as well. Just wondering if you can comment on whether you believe the French fiber stake sale make the possibility of your participation in France consolidation more or less likely?"
Malo Corbin,1,"Thank you. So on your first question, on the trends, what is very important this year, and I think, what was said, it was a turnaround year is that we came back with net adds in both the fixed and the mobile. Of course, you will always have to go through the 12-month to see all the benefit of that. Second point, I think, it's very important to note that for the second quarter, we are growing not only the RED brand, but also the SFR brand. And for the first months, you always have the promotion, but in 12 months time, you will see the benefit when people will exit promotion and will have the uplift in the ARPU.
So on the B2B, you can see, quarter-over-quarter, we are improving the trend year-over-year. Basically, we are very confident that we'll go back to growth very quickly on the B2B segment in France. Now coming to your question on the fiber. Again, you have to understand that we are talking here about the mid- and low-dense area where effectively you basically have two large infrastructure players, being Orange and SFR, and effectively, the other telecom players will rent this infrastructure. So there is no negative of doing that transaction for consolidation in the French market."
Patrick Drahi,1,"Maybe – this is Patrick. Maybe I can add a little point here, Malo. Actually, your point was clear. Just to add something about our confidence in growth versus our peers. And Malo mentioned the B2B, and by doing the fiber acceleration of the low-dense area, actually, our competitors will have two choices. One, not to rent this fiber from us and lose all their DSL customers to us, which is fine with me. And two, use our fiber infrastructure in these areas and this will make a huge position for SFR in the wholesale market in France that is why we are so confident for next year.
And if you look at what is happening in Portugal, in the last two, three years, our competitors were growing a lot and we were declining a lot, but we are declining almost nothing and our competitors are almost nothing. And I believe we will have an inversion because from far all operators look the same, but when you dig a little bit, they are very different, some operators have infrastructure and content, some operators have infrastructure and the content and some operators have no infrastructure and no content and that long-term makes a big difference. And this we see it today, and we'll see it even more next year with both subscriber falling into a extra [indiscernible] period and content revenues and wholesale revenues and B2B coming back. So this is the reason why we are all super confident for next year."
Andrew Lee,1,Thank you.
Operator,1,Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Khanna from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Vivek Khanna,1,"Hello, good afternoon everyone. A couple of – three questions, if I may. The first one is just to get an understanding of what traction you're getting for your Champions League? Of the 378,000 postpaid mobile additions, can you give us a feel as to what portion of their – of them are actually also signing up for a form of sports package? And then, the second question is related still to broadband. Clearly, the DSL losses are less than what they have been in the past. I suspect there is an element of promotional activity in order to complete with some of the other sort of lower value operators in the market. I'm just trying to understand if you give us a feel as to what ARPU ex VAT, what the trends are in fiber versus DSL in that segment, please?"
Malo Corbin,1,"Okay. So on the first question of the – on the Champions League traction, I think, it's very important to note that today this project is available to SFR Telecom customers at EUR 9 per month. And we have launched in September or in December, the OTT product available at EUR 19 [ph] and I think, you have seen in the slide, the strong take up we had in OTT customer. And also, it’s very important we have signed a deal with Canal+ for the satellite customer and – because the satellite customer of Canal+ are not really in competition with the telecom subscribers we are looking for at SFR.
On the mobile customer, what is the percentage taking the spot option? I think this is an information we cannot release because it is – in terms of competition is very sensitive, and we don’t want to have the other player in the market to have access with this information. And on your third question, the speed of the ARPU between DSL and fiber, I don’t think this is an information we usually provide to the market."
Vivek Khanna,1,Thank you.
Operator,1,Your next question comes from the line of Josh Hallett from Redburn. Your line is open.
Josh Hallett,1,"Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. The first one on the four times net debt-to-EBITDA target, you said, you’re very confident on that. But could you give us a bit of an idea around timing? I mean, once you get the infrastructure deals done and then a couple of years, you think you are there? So when you think that will happen? And then my next question is what’s the plan B? You sound very confident on next year, but what happens if things just carry on as they are in France? What would you do? What’s the option? And finally, on the 114,000 RMC Sports subscribers, what does that exact number mean? Is that refers to people who are paying for the website, but they are not SFR customers, I didn’t quite understand what that KPI refers to? Thanks very much."
Dennis Okhuijsen,1,"Yes. I think on the deleveraging, I think, we clearly cannot give you guidance, I guess, when we will be hitting the target. I think, we can assure everybody that it remains our top priority and that we will clearly be very focused to delever as we are executing our plan and that’s our number one priority. And we are extremely confident that we will be able to delever as we’re not relying on one single item to turn in our favor or to be more positive. I think, we feel, we have a whole portfolio of operational improvements and revenue growth opportunities in both France and Portugal that are coming into play. And this is not only one segment of the business in France, but we think all the segments in France will have a significant improvement versus this year, which was clearly the year of the KPI.
I think next year, it is clearly the year of harvesting debt, and I think, we are very confident around all the lines of business in both France and Portugal to do much better. And on top of that, we think the strategic review and what we have found out so far on the fiber project in France and what we are found out earlier in the year where we executed better-than-expected deals on the tower side, we feel that we’ll be deleveraging, and we also feel that the French process on the fiber is already derisked because we already have seen the proposals. And I think if you roll that time of thinking over the other infrastructure that we have, we can see a significant deleveraging on the horizon. And like I said, we’re not relying on a single item here to delever. So we feel very confident in 2019 that we will be getting a significant deleveraging done from the 5.6 times, which we are reporting today."
Malo Corbin,1,"And I think on your last question on the 114,000 OTT customer, effectively, these are the customer who are taking the OTT product effectively, which are not SFR Telecom customers. So they could be a customer of our competitors."
Josh Hallett,1,Okay. Fantastic. Thanks very much.
Operator,1,Your next question comes from line of Frederic Boulan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Frederic Boulan,1,"Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. Two, so one question and then a one follow-up. So first of all, to come back on the revenue and ARPU discussions in the French market, you mentioned strong KPIs will drive revenue, but at the same time, we see ARPU is trailing down pretty quickly both in fixed and mobile. So first of all, within that, is it a clean number? Are you also adding low ARPU, for instance, RMC Sports customers in fixed and mobile subs, which is cosmetically hitting ARPU? And then don’t you think it’s time to focus more on ARPU and revenue growth instead of – and probably forgetting a bit about quarterly additions, which are not really delivering revenue growth?
And then secondly, a bit of follow-up on that, on your plan to return to growth, considering the 12% EBITDA decline in France, some of it is relative, but – and the decline we are seeing at the group level. Do you expect 2019 to start to see growth in revenues and EBITDA in France and then similarly at the group level? Is this a realistic time frame? Or do you think the recovery will take more time? Thank you."
Malo Corbin,1,"On your first question on the revenue and ARPU and RMC Sports, so effectively, the RMC Sport OTT customer are not – this benefit is not in the ARPU we have here. I think it’s very important to note that, of course, the ARPU is down year-over-year with the VAT benefit with price increases that we had in December last year. But when you look at the quarter-over-quarter, you see that both, I think, on the fixed B2C and on the mobile postpaid, the ARPU are down 1% compared to the second quarter. And of course, the focus for the group remain on both the KPIs, the revenue trend, but also on the cash flow generation as Dennis was mentioning. And to your last point on the return to growth, again, we’re very confident that the B2B in France will go back to growth very quickly and on the France – on the B2C and wholesale side, also, we believe that in the course of 2018 – 2019, sorry, we’ll go back to growth on the wholesale benefiting from the FTTH wholesale market and on the B2C because we’ll have all the benefit of all the customer we got this year that will further materialize next year."
Dennis Okhuijsen,1,"And remember, we’re not only focused here on volume because remember we were selling additional content. We also are not only selling via the web. We have a very sophisticated infrastructure in terms of shops, where we are generating a much higher ARPU level. So we are not just focused on volume here. I think, we are clearly targeting profitable revenue growth. And I think with the subscribers mix that we are adding in the last few quarters, we think these are very profitable subscribers in 2019. So hence, we very much concur with the strategy that we have today."
Malo Corbin,1,"And I think to complement that on Portugal, just to say a word on Portugal. As you can see, the growth in Q3 was minus 0.3% versus Q3 2017, growing versus since Q2, and we see that improving in the coming quarter as well. So you will also have growth in Portugal."
Frederic Boulan,1,Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator,1,Your next question comes from the line of Jakob Bluestone from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Jakob Bluestone,1,"Hi, good evening. I’ve got a question and a follow-up as well. I’m still struggling a little bit understanding the B2C ARPU trends and sort of outlook. Can you maybe just help us understand a little bit why such a big deterioration just sort of breaking down, for example, mobile ARPU go from minus 7% to minus 11% year-on-year? And then also what is that's actually going to drive a recovery?
I think you mentioned that when customers roll off promotions, the ARPUs improve. But if I, for example, look at the website for RED, the strap line is that the ARPU doesn't double after a year or so, some of these promotions are permanent. So if you can just help us understand why you expect a rebound in ARPU on the consumer side? And then just also as a follow-up, obviously, most of the discussion you've had on selling fiber in France is selling FTTH. Would you be willing to sell minority stakes in your cable network as well? Thank you."
Malo Corbin,1,"On the first question on the B2C ARPU year-over-year, so first, you have to remember that you have the VAT impact, one. Two, as you may remember, we had price increases in December 2017, which effectively we lost the benefit of that ARPU increase now. So when you compare year-over-year, it's impacting negatively the comparison. Three, last summer as well on the SFR brand, we had offer called [indiscernible] without any uplift after 12 months, so you don't see the benefit today of what would have been the uplift.
On your comment on the RED, which has a flat price on the website. First, I think, we are growing not only the RED customer base today, but also the SFR customer base. Two, of course, on the website, you see a flat rate, but over the coming years, you will never have a flat rate. I think, it's like if you were looking two years ago, when we only had the 3G product. Of course, with the 4G product, the offers have moved up, and I think in the coming years, you will enrich your product, so those rates will never stay at that level. On your last point, selling minority stake in the cable network, maybe Patrick, you want to say a word on that?"
Patrick Drahi,1,"Yes. Well, it’s a good question. First of all, I lost my cable network, so if somebody loves it as much as I do, I'm very open to sell a piece of it. So I think a good momentum on the market today on the fiber project. As Dennis said, we already have received the offers from many financial potential partners, and we are quite happy with what we see. And we started with the apparatus which is the fiber we built, and we then we will see what happens there. And main course is as you said the cable that will need to be upgraded to full FTTH over time and in which we have a coverage of 100% of the high-dense area, but also of part of the low-dense area, where we can be a good alternative, and therefore, also participate to work wholesale revenue in the future.
So as you see, not only we have expanded our fixed network in France, we are actually one operator with fixed infrastructure in France. One is expanding from, let's say, 9.5 million homes passed cable to potentially today 15 million homes passed FTTH and FTTB, and the other one is going from 30 million DSL down to 20 million fiber. And of course, we will cover all of France with fiber. 50% today of France will be covered by our own fiber, this 15 million I just mentioned, and the other 15 million will use the network of the others.
So if you think about this not only we are going to generate huge wholesale revenues in the future, but on top of that, we are going to continue to reduce our cost [indiscernible] because we were – of 30 million homes in France, we were renting 20 million on DSL [indiscernible] in the future. As of today, we will rent less than 15 million. And if we win more project for FTTH in France, it will be even less than that. And as Alain explained in the beginning and I must thank Alain because he has been very, very important in this game since the beginning of the year.
We started 2018 with 2 million homes under franchise for FTTH, and as of now, we have 4.7 million. So we more than doubled, and this is why we do this project, not only because of looking for additional money at a good price, but also to actually rise the deployment. The quicker we will deploy, then most people will migrate to fiber, which means wholesale revenue is going to grow very high quickly. And without giving the number, I may not want to give precise number, our DSL ARPU is much lower than our fiber ARPU. So it's good for everything, it's good for wholesale, it's good for our ARPU and also good for churn. Our churn in fiber is much lower than our churn in DSL."
Jakob Bluestone,1,Thanks very much.
Operator,1,Our last question comes from the line of Nicolas Cote-Colisson of HSBC. Your line is open.
Nicolas Cote-Colisson,1,"Thank you. The question on the asset disposals. Can you explain the cash flow contingencies of selling all of your towers in Portugal and Dominican Republic, but also half of your towers in France? If you can just help us understanding what the impact in terms of cash flows, OpEx, CapEx excluding the transaction proceeds, obviously? Thank you."
Dennis Okhuijsen,1,"I think it’s too early to disclose, I think what the fiber projects would do in terms of cash flow dynamics."
Nicolas Cote-Colisson,1,"I’m sorry, it was not the towers."
Dennis Okhuijsen,1,"Okay. I think, on the towers, the French towers, we clearly continue to consolidate still, so we are getting proceeds in and there is then a dividend that we're paying out effectively to the minority shareholder, which is a relatively modest dividend. And I think it's probably a good proxy that you use the acquisition multiples that we have disclosed for Portugal and DR are probably a good proxy what the rental charges that we are taking on board as we move on renting this infrastructure in those two countries."
Nicolas Cote-Colisson,1,"Okay, okay. Thank you."
Operator,1,"And this does conclude the Q&A portion of today’s call. And we have maxed out the time allotted. So, I would like to thank everyone for joining today. And you may now disconnect. Have a great day."
Alain Weill,1,Thank you.
