Operator,0,"Good morning. My name is Christine and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Energold Drilling Corp’s First Quarter Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.
Jerry Huang, Manager of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. "
Jerry Huang ,0,"Thank you, Christine. Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Energold Drilling's Q1 2018 period ending March 31, 2018 financial results conference call. Before we begin, we'd like to go over our disclosure statement, followed by Mr. Gold's comments on the quarter results and the Q&A period. 
Certain statements in the following conference call following Energold Drilling business operations may constitute forward-looking statements, such statements are not historical facts but are predictions about the future, which inherently involves risks and uncertainties and may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.
I would like to now turn it over to the CFO, Steven Gold. "
Steven Gold,0,"Thank you, Jerry. Good morning, everyone. It’s been not too long since we spoke last on our annual conference call but we will be able to provide you an update here after for the quarter. 
Revenue in the period increased really across the board. On the mineral side, we were actually quite busy for what would be typically a first quarter as well as on the energy side and manufacturing side. Group revenue as a whole was $23.9 million compared to $19.1 million in the same period of 2017, that’s a 25% increase on a year-over-year basis. Improvements across all the divisions were the result for the period’s improvement on the financial basis. And we are seeing generally an overall better drilling climate, especially in the mineral and energy sides, while delivering improvements in the manufacturing segment led to an increase in that area.
Mineral revenue improved by more than 12% while the energy segment’s revenue improved by more than 11% along with more than doubling the manufacturing revenue base on a year-over-year basis. Gross margin on a group wide basis improved to $5.7 million, that’s 27% increase over the same period in 2017. We returned to a positive EBITDA situation, while the net loss unfortunately was $0.04 a share, this compares to a loss of $0.06 per share in the same period last year. 
At the end of the quarter, Energold had cash on hand of $5.9 million and $57.5 million in working capital. Following years of cost cutting and tight margins and losses in other cases, the improving climate for commodity exploration has led to a strong first quarter for the company in the current climate. Annual revenues increased to $10.8 million in the first quarter from $9.6 million in the same period last year. 
Meters drilled increased to 72,400 in mineral segment compared to 63,300 in 2017. As discussed, activity in the mineral segment continues to improve following stronger sustained commodity prices and an overall improving funding climate for junior and intermediate exploration companies in 2017, which has translated into exploration dollars in 2018. 
Capacity in certain markets is tightening resulting in a stronger competitive position for the company. Specifically, West African and South American activity is growing considerably compared to past years, resulting in most of the improvement in the first quarter’s activity. 
Pricing in the mineral division remains competitive, however, although some improvements in certain regions are apparent, especially where the company continues to hold a presence over the years, while our -- or at least some of our other competitors had left. This has left limited service providers as a result. 
On the energy drilling side, our revenues for the three months ended March 31st, were 3.6 million compared to 7.8 million in the same period of 2017. Gross margin of 2.8 million or 32% compares to 2.9 million or 37% in the same period last year. Margins remain strong in this division due to increased activity in the oil sands, which saw meters drilled improved by over 60% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. 
Some of the new geothermal contracts announced in March are currently ramping up in the second quarter and are expected to make a meaningful impact on the company's financial results this year, having seen a near doubling of activity in the recent quarter on a year-over-year basis. 
The company has specifically won several sustainable energy businesses, business contracts as it seeks to increase its utilization of its equipment in slower spring and summer months. Specifically, we are using equipment that we typically use in the winter and store for the summer, we’re now using that equipment in the summer to create a second season.
Global investments and development in renewable energy and infrastructure has opened up a sizable market with the company, recently, substantial contracts have been awarded including $10 million in the United States and $9 million in Canada, where some of this work has already begun as discussed and the balance is expected to be completed between the current quarter and year-end. 
At the manufacturing level following a substantial reorganization including staff reductions and more focused and modern -- and a modern product portfolio. The manufacturing segment started to recover in the first quarter. Revenues for Dando, the manufacturing division in the first quarter were 4.4 million with a gross profit of 16%. This compares to revenue of 1.7 million and a gross profit of 5% in the same period last year. This marked improvement is a result of increased efficiencies in our contract delivery process. Energold is committed to Dando’s success and management believes there is a substantial opportunity for drilling, manufacturing market especially in the water drilling segment.
Moving over to the outlook, management has made significant changes in each of the divisions over the last several years that has set the company up as a whole to benefit from improving fundamentals. Cost cutting, investment in new equipment and developing new drilling markets succeeded in growing activity levels in each division. The mineral drilling division is expected to continue to show improvement over the balance of 2018. The company's order book remains strong, especially in parts of Central and South America where Energold holds leading market share positions. As capacity utilization improves, management expects pricing trends to follow while keeping costs under control. 
In the energy, sustainable energy and infrastructure division, higher oil prices and continued investments in projects in North America are expected to further grow the order book until the end of ‘18 and beyond, when equipment is reallocated to the oil patch in the winter season. Meanwhile in the manufacturing segment, management expects the recent restructuring to continue to improve the division's financial performance and continue to grow profitability over the balance of the year. New investments will be made where there is an economical case to do so. Working capital and startup cash are integral to winning new businesses, and therefore, management must continue to evaluate each opportunity on a selective basis to ensure the best use of funds. Notwithstanding the company is seeing more opportunities in an excess as contracts and new business will continue to come to the door however new projects will be taken on a case-by-case basis. 
That summarizes my brief comments. Operator I’ll pass it over to you to receive any questions."
Operator,1,Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of James Moore from J.R. Moore Associates. Your line is open.
James Moore,1,"So, it's more about the debt level that you guys currently have. I know that convertible is what it is. But I saw the bank debts creeping up a little bit, can you just talk a little about that and any plans you have to make sure that you're paying off the bank debt as your finances improve and the opportunities improve?"
Steven Gold,1,"Yes, sure. On the bank debt, much of that is really just working capital lines to expand the business, so that debt in particular is not going to keep the lights on so to speak, there is business for that. These are lines that we take on where we go to our lender and say we have a contract in Argentina, we're going to need $240,000 for startup and the debt in that case is right up against that contract, in particular, rather than a broad working line where we can draw as we see fit. So that's a reason for the creep. It's much more to do with business coming through the door. At the end of the quarter we have about $6 million in cash and that’s fine but it also creates a scenario where we've had unfortunately had to turn down some contracts, because it costs about $60,000 per rig to get it out into the field. So that's reason for that bank indebtedness."
James Moore,1,"Okay, so I assume that, you guys -- that’s just a short-term thing, you guys are probably trying to pay off when you can once you get it [multiple speakers]."
Steven Gold,1,"Yes, we are not going into details which will nothing but bore you, but I am happy to share. Basically, as money comes in for those contracts it goes straight to paying that piece of debt."
James Moore,1,And then can you talk about the seasonality of the opportunities that you have for this year in terms of where we should expect? Or if you guys have any visibility into that aside from the regular seasonal trends in terms of where you expect some of the projects that might balloon in certain quarters versus others given the large contracts you guys talked about.
Steven Gold,1,"So, the green energy, sustainable energy whatever you want to call it is certainly a spring summer early fall thing. Its partially done by design because again those -- the rigs we use for that equipment is spoken for in the winter. So, from a seasonal perspective you saw a lot of the green stuff happen in the next couple of quarters. Mineral is always busy in Q2 and more so in Q3 assuming weather cooperates. Interestingly enough we had a pretty good recent terms of meters drilled, we had a very good Q1. So, it was unseasonably better than expected. And energy is always in the winter months. So, it's sort of broken down like that. 
The green site is interesting, specifically because I suppose we could do that at any time during the year, but again it truly is a matter of a rig availability rather than when these -- when this drilling tends to take place."
James Moore,1,"And also, could you talk about the total sense business just what you're seeing there now at the prices creeping up."
Steven Gold,1,"Well, the quarter in particular that we just had I think it shows that improvement sort of in a nutshell, just pointing a number here. So, in the first quarter, we did 18,600 meters of drilling in the oil sands only, and the year before was 11,600 so you have both 7000 meters there and that is solely and only because of a better oil price."
James Moore,1,"And just my last one. The last -- I don’t know I guess call it six years or so have been pretty rough in terms of operating losses and just net losses generally. So, I guess just in terms of driving shareholder value stock price over that period to down very high double digits, is your main focus that you are trying to get to that is definitely great that you guys are having this period of major tailwinds you are back right now. But I guess something you guys are working on to make sure that this can sustain itself when we hit another period of commodity prices decline."
Steven Gold,1,"Yes, so -- I mean I think rough is an understatement for last six years. But as far as what to do if commodity prices take another dip and something we can point to specifically is that green energy. On one hand, we know what we are and that’s certainly a commodity drilling company, but we have to create different businesses so that we can survive. Now over the last six years, while mineral took a dip up until a few years ago the energy was actually doing quite well, while the metal prices dropped, oil was $100 plus for some time and obviously that had ended. But we are trying to create these other businesses with the fleet we already have. So new verticals if you will, without having to make a major investment so that if commodity prices dip we do have something else. I mean the green energy has really very little to do with the commodity prices in general, yes, you might make a connection between high energy prices and the will to go into renewable. But a lot of this money is federal, its provincial, its state. And this type business tries to expose ourselves to so that we have $20 million in green energy business and if the mineral business drops so we see about the cushion. 
So, long answer to a short question the reality is that all I think we can do is go and find new business and take advantage of the business that we have been in for 20 years. As far as for our shareholder value perspective, we -- are frugal when we spend, we take contracts that offer enough of a profit margin that if something goes wrong we will still make money. And unfortunately, it’s a business where there are costs that are quite fixed and we can improve a loss and hopefully turn to a profit at net level towards the end of the year, but really, I think there's all sorts of different ideas how can we improve shareholder value at the end of the day, it's going to have to come from obviously our results."
Operator,1,Your next question comes from the line of Larry [Barkin] a Private Investor. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst,1,"Hi, good morning. I'm looking at the stock and I see absolutely no trades this morning which is kind of surprising last quarter was a kind of a disaster, the results looked -- at least to me they looked very good, what you guys have talked about and kind of getting back to shareholder value. And by the way where’s Fred today?"
Steven Gold,1,He’s traveling to South America.
Unidentified Analyst,1,"Okay, because this is second call. I guess it’s getting back to more shareholder value, I mean this looked like a very good result, you’re starting to really turn the corner, and absolutely no trades at all at least here in the U.S., which I'm sure is frustrating that to you guys, when you have bad news you get hammered. But when you have good news you should get some positive results. People buying the stock."
Steven Gold,1,We agree.
Unidentified Analyst,1,"So, I think that’s basically my comment just kind of a surprise. Last quarter did any of the insiders buy any stock and would there be any plans to buy some stock if it stays right where it is?"
Steven Gold,1,"So, we -- because of proximity of Q1 to Q4 it’s been -- because it’s been just over a month so we had been blacked out from start to finish, but I am -- from my casual conversations with my colleagues I anticipate now that we’re coming out of this and seeing these wins that are back. I think that you probably see that ramped up in the coming months. But I think there was literally two days in the last five weeks that we are able to buy it just because we’ve come out of the audit into Q1."
Unidentified Analyst,1,"If it stays here existed -- these results are night and day difference which you guys have been talking about for a long time, finally starting to see some fairly big increases. Oil has been reacting very positively so that should continue to help gold. Gold hasn't exactly been great but it's still hanging in there. So, I'm imagining that over the next several quarters you expect to continue to see positive results and positive EBITDA?"
Steven Gold,1,"We think so Larry, I think we’ve been talking about cost cutting and you can only cut cost so much, I mean the reality is that more business is coming in the door, but we need just a little bit more to get over that fixed cost level. Yes -- let me go a different way, the noise that we see around the business is quite quiet now, what I mean by that is two years ago, 2016 was interesting. We had some business coming in, but we had some bad debt and we had ground conditions that weren’t scouted properly by a customer and they were all this kind of bickering back and forth within the industry and now we’re almost at a point, where the industry is clean, the business out there is real, the company is providing this business is real and all we have to do is simple, all we have to do is go open the business and do it right. 
It seems like the last few years we’re spending most of our time, putting out little fires and now what we’ve to do is just generate business and ensure that we have the working capital, startup capital to enter into particular contracts. I can’t underestimate, or rather, I can't overemphasize rather the degree to which -- some of our competitors have gone completely bankrupt over the last few years and on our side yes we take out a lot of debt to continue the operations to win that new business but at the end of the day the businesses there we have the money to support the startup capital, we have the lenders that are willing to help support us and business there, and we win it and then again from the last question on the call, we should be able to see another side of this towards the end of this year where you do start seeing that profitability and something more sustained."
Unidentified Analyst,1,"Now oil stays plus or minus in this range, I mean lets now assume it goes up to 80-90 whatever but 60s to 70s. I mean that should continue to be positive for you, should then have gold finally gets over 1300 where it is today, but starts to really take off. I mean all of that should be net positive going forward. Are you going to -- stays where it is right now?"
Steven Gold,1,"There's more torque in the oil for sure just because it's faster, these are big companies that we are dealing with. So, it's not like -- gold goes to $1,400. The juniors go and raise money and then it takes time for those deals to close and the money takes time to flow its way to the field and so and so forth. Whereas oil of these customers, they already have cash question do they want to spend it. And there's definitely a level in oil that people are more or our customers are more comfortable spending that money. Again, the mineral side it's interesting at 1320 years or 1340 gold yes dropped off since. Some of these companies still weren’t able to raise money even with the move up. And if they are not raising money, they are not spending money. So, over the longer term they can't raise money certainly, that's a very profitable business and we do it quite well. But the oil price right around here whether its 66 or 61 -- don’t forget a lot of our increase in business that it was substantial in Q1 on the oil side was $60 oil and $55 oil. So now we are about $10 higher than that."
Unidentified Analyst,1,$10 higher than that.
Steven Gold,1,"Yes, but unfortunately, we are going to summer and nobody drills anyway. So, we can only hope that it hangs it, it doesn’t have to go to $150 it just sort of hang around out here and you will see an uptick across the industry not just us in terms of expiration activity."
Unidentified Analyst,1,"Now what about geopolitically with Iran and Venezuela and places like that, if that starts to really impact things more where oil does go up, where there is less -- we need to drill more that should be only positive for us if there are more tensions in the area."
Steven Gold,1,"It would help. Unfortunately, however, we drill oil fans and that oil is trapped for the foreseeable future. So not to speculate on the Kinder Morgan deal this morning that helps. It gives our customers a lot more confidence that the oil will leave Alberta, but as far as tensions in oil price again that we need oil to be around this level, maybe can even drop $10 and we think that our customers are still happy to continue the work they're doing. So yes, some of it is emotional as far as they are concerned, I'm sure there's a lot more economic. But if they have visibility to get the oil out of Alberta, which seems to be a lot more now after this morning, and they have an oil price [multiple speakers]"
Unidentified Analyst,1,I must have missed that on the call what happened with Kinder Morgan and…
Steven Gold,1,"They sold the pipeline to the Canadian government who will indemnify future losses and so forth. So, the pipeline is going to get built. So, we spoke to one of our customers this morning who says this is just one less risk that they account for in their models when they're looking at how much money they want to spend on development."
Unidentified Analyst,1,So that should be a net positive for us.
Steven Gold,1,It should be.
Unidentified Analyst,1,But its -- then it’s a matter of timing.
Steven Gold,1,"Certainly, but we are -- our customers delineate resources that they obviously they know to be there. And the work we do is a lot different. It's completely different than a couple of explorer drilling in the foothills of Alberta. The work we're doing is more of a resource management kind of process."
Unidentified Analyst,1,"Are any of the other competitors, I know Jerry and I talk about major and some of the others, are any of them close -- closer to bankruptcy, which obviously could be a positive, for less competition we have or how are they -- some of those guys doing now?"
Steven Gold,1,"I’ve no idea. A lot of them are private companies but we’re competing, it’s the same guys on a regular basis, so."
Unidentified Analyst,1,And they’re still out there?
Steven Gold,1,Yes.
Operator,1,Your next question comes from the line of James Moore from J.R. Moore Associates. Your line is open.
James Moore,1,"Just a follow-up to the previous questions about -- you mentioned insider purchases. I guess I am curious also in terms of what kind of appetite like Fred and the other substantial holders, they’ve had their shares obviously diluted over the years just given the constant issuance of shares and then solution just from warrants and the convertible and other stuff, what kind of appetite do they have, to sell their stake, is there, a line that once they decide okay they’ve spent so much time on this business and they’re ready to kind of throw their hands up and sell?"
Steven Gold,1,"As far as I know there’s no plans. It’s probably more of a question you'd have to ask him directly. I don't know what his financial planning is, I know that he is going down to South America today, to work on a contract, so I don't think he has any plans to go anywhere."
James Moore,1,And then one more on the -- do you guys have any room for share repurchases from the corporate level or are you guys restricted on your debt obligation? And are you guys still trading below liquidation value that you’ve been for some time now? 
Steven Gold,1,"It is more an issue of where dollars are better spent. I mean working capital is king right now and we need to preserve our cash to take management contract, as we said we are carrying contracts that may not work for us and at $60,000 per start up cost for each rig we have no intentions of doing share repurchase right now. And yes, there are issues with respect to a lender that we cannot just go ahead and do that and from a shareholder's perspective, it’s more in our interest to invest in these new contracts and do that."
Operator,1,Your next question comes from the line of Buck Bandura from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Buck Bandura,1,"I heard some of the other calls, I am impressed to see the revenues ramped up, when will the EPS ramp up, that’s when I think the stock will start to ramp, at least that’s what I am waiting for as this year earnings per year starts to ramp up, is there any forecast or anticipation when that would -- we’ll see positive EPS?"
Steven Gold,1,"Yes, I agree with that, Buck I think as I just mentioned the -- on one or two callers ago, the issue has to do with fixed level costs, so we just have to get above -- so we’re getting closer to that, and closer to that and closer to that, and we’ve to get above that. So, as sort of a rule of thumb, we have some accelerated amortization, it’s $1.5 million, $1.7 million a quarter. That has to do with an acquisition years ago that we’re -- that’s just an accounting treatment, but I think if we can get to sort of the high $20 million, $30 million mark that would throw us over that breakeven at the net level, the margins on the new stuff that we’re doing is actually quite profitable. The green energy business is reasonably profitable and from -- if I look at my fixed costs here it's -- there's not all that much left to cut. But there's nothing that strikes me, is going up anymore. So, I look at the cost profile and say, at $5.5 million including the amortization level I don't see creeping up higher than that so it’s just a matter of getting that revenue to kind of the $29 million mark per quarter."
Buck Bandura,1,"And one last question is -- and I know nothing about how to secure a contract, but shouldn’t your customers may be paid to move the equipment or is that just not possible, is not competitive enough to get them to pick up the cost to get an equipment in place?"
Steven Gold,1,"Yes, there's a time for that, in 2010 we had a customer that paid us money just to be on the waiting list and it's really just a question of how tight the market is, there’s lots of drilling providers in a particular area. The customers are just going to tell you, I’m not writing a check until you invoice me. It is 100% competitive, we’ve had customers where they have paid us six months in advance to move a rig and we've had customers that have told us to just invoice me. At the end of the day the customers do pay it, they can say it's just a question of who's putting up the money. It's -- the moving costs are borne by the customer. It is a cost of doing business as far as they’re concerned, it's just whether or not they front the money or whether we front the money."
Operator,1,There’re no further questions at this time. Mr. Jerry Huang I’ll turn the call back over to you.
Jerry Huang,1,"Great, thanks for staying. Thank you everyone, and joining us in reviewing Q1 2018 financial and production results for Energold Drilling Corp. We look forward to our next quarter’s call. If you have any questions or would like to submit questions for our next call, please visit our website at www.energold.com or by phone at 604-681-9501. Thank you for your continued support of Energold Drilling Group. Have a great day."
Operator,1,This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.
