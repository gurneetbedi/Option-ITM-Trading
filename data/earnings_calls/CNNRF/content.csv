Marc Lustig,0,"Thanks, Jon. Good morning everyone and thank you for participating on our earnings call. I’m joined today by Francois Perrault, Chief Financial Officer; and Afzal Hasan, President and General Counsel.
Given that our last call was just over a month ago, we are going to keep our prepared comments relatively short today to ensure we get to any questions. Our team has been hard at work, building what we believe will be a market-leading platform in California and a marquee name in the Canadian publicly traded cannabis sector.
Over the past five months, we have announced the acquisition of substantial revenue generating Canada’s operators including distributors Alta and River that generated US$31.9 million in revenue in 2017. Also Kaya produced US$8 million in revenue in 2017 including the revenue that was generated by the former manufacturer of Bhang edibles. FloraCal generated US$6.4 million in revenue in 2017 along with US$3.2 million in EBITDA. The impact of these transactions and the true financial power of the platform we have assembled will become very apparent in Q2 as sequential revenue ramps significantly. This will carry over into Q3 when we expect to have our recent transactions including River and FloraCal on our books for a full quarter. And these revenues are growing as outlined in our May 4th announcement, record monthly sales at Alta as well as a banner month of sales for River.
In 2017, we made a calculated decision to focus on distribution as a means to achieve our long-term objective of becoming a leading cannabis consumer products company. The reason we focused on distribution is that in California distributors occupy a unique position at the nexus of the value chain. They collect taxes for the state, ensure product quality for consumers through robust lab testing, facilitate the growth of exciting consumer brands and ensure the dispensary operators have access to a full product shelf.
The value of the data that we control, the access to growing brands and the dispensary relationships that we have fostered, are all long-term competitive advantages as we aim to on-board the winners in the cannabis brand game.
Over the past several months, we have established a beachhead in Canada to eventually bring our leading products home and we expect to continue to make progress on this significant opportunity over the balance of the year. So, stay tuned for developments in Canada.
I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Mike Ruscetta as the CEO of Trichome which we own 70% of and which is in the process of being launched. So, look for news on that front soon. Mike is an incredibly qualified capital markets professional and a proven investor. I would also like to thank Afzal Hasan for his significant contribution to our strategic direction and the execution of that strategy over the past year, and welcome Afzal in his new role as President.
I will now pass the call over to Francois for some detail on the financials."
Francois Perrault,0,"Thanks, Marc and good morning, everyone.
As Marc discussed, 2018 has been -- has already been a very active year for CannaRoyalty as our team works to seize a historic opportunity to become a leading cannabis consumer products company in the State of California, and eventually, globally.
Q1 was a transitional quarter, so I won’t spend a lot of time diving deep into the numbers but the most notable change from last quarter is that we consolidated our Kaya and Alta acquisitions, which took effect on March 27th. The total purchase consideration for these entities was just over $14 million, split roughly $1 million to tangible net assets, $5 million to intangibles and $8 million to goodwill. It’s important to note that our Q1 income statement only reflects about $85,000 in product sales from these businesses, since we only closed these transactions on March 27th, as I mentioned earlier.
I would also remind you that we took the opportunity during Q1 to consolidate the manufacturing of all our in-house brands into Kaya’s license production facility in Oakland, California. Because we relied solely on Kaya for all our production, sales for CannaRoyalty’s GreenRock Botanicals and Soul Sugar Kitchen branded products in the quarter consisted only of activity from March 28th to March 31st. Moving production in-house was an important exercise as it gets us away from using contract manufacturing from these product lines.
Kaya now produces all of CannaRoyalty’s branded products as well as Bhang cannabis products sold in the State of California. We expect the consolidation of manufacturing operations under Kaya will drive substantial quarter-over-quarter growth through the remainder of 2018 starting in Q2. This transition was a primary reason for the decline in quarterly sequential revenue and was part of the reason for the weak gross margin performance during the quarter. As Marc mentioned, we expect this situation to revert rapidly and sustainably starting in Q2, which is already well underway.
We held Q1 operating expenses roughly steady with the prior quarter but we expect to scale expenses and investments significantly in the coming quarters on infrastructure and human capital as we remain laser focused on our plan to grow our product sales in California and eventually globally. Our cash position exiting the quarter was stronger, given $4.7 million and one proceeds received. Following the end of Q1, our cash position increased further. On April 13th, we closed the bought deal financing and on the 18th, the over-allotment was exercised, bringing in a total of $16 million in net proceeds and we also have $10 million available on our operating line with Sprott.
I’d now like to hand it over to Afzal Hasan, our new President."
Afzal Hasan,0,"Thanks, Francois.
Our acquisitions of Alta, Kaya and River have and will provide us with the foundational elements required to support the global cannabis consumer product brand for the future. I would like to build on what Marc said for a moment, because although we do want to be a global products business in the cannabis industry, we’re taking a different route than most other cannabis players in the market today. No matter what those industry players may suggest, nobody can pick [ph] the future of Coke or Pepsi or cannabis today with any degree of certainty.
Our belief is founded on a variety of factors identified during our three-year history as a diversified multi-jurisdictional investors. A major reason is that the mix of cannabis products that will be on the shelves in a few years will be different than the products that are on the shelves today. We are confident of this, based on our historical observations of substantial changes in the base edibles and other products on shelves in the markets that allow them as well as first hand evaluation of a multitude of products currently in development. It is an involving space. And with widespread adult use legislation and the introduction of new consumers into the market, the speed of change will only increase.
The exceptions to this general principle are products that have already reached an advanced stage of development. Cannabis flower is one of those categories, which is why we saw a significant opportunity in FloraCal, one of River’s most successful producers. While flower will still evolve to some degree, its cultivation has been refined over millennia. Although many can cultivate flower well, FloraCal was unique to us because we’re able to home their art of cultivation into a consistent authentic CPG product with highly scalable production.
By positioning ourselves strategically between promising brands and leading California retailers, we are well-positioned to enable the growth of the brands of the future and seize on the opportunities to work with them both in California as well as globally. Being a distributor also allows us to support the growth of our downstream retail partners. Just yesterday, we announced an agreement with Posh Green, a premium San Francisco based delivery service to expand our distribution network in the state and also gain experience with cannabis product delivery.
Coming back to my original point, although we may be different from our cannabis competitors, we bear strong resemblance to mature market players in other industries where buying global leading brand companies in alcohol, soft drinks, coffee, snack foods and tobacco is a robust distribution platform and this is how CannaRoyalty is positioned in the cannabis space. We are confident that California is where the global brands of the future will emerge and grow. California’s regulators are committed to an open and competitive market, both on the product side as well as right through the distribution chains to consumers. California has proven its ability to influence popular culture and built sustainable consumer brands across sectors. With the support of regulatory framework, we are confident that the California cannabis brands will similarly have a significant global impact.
At this point, I’d like to ask the operator to open the lines for questions."
Operator,1,[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Matt Bottomley with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Matt Bottomley,1,"Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Yes. So, maybe just a few quick housekeeping items before I get into the sort of bigger picture stuff that’s been going on with you guys over the last few months. Just on the product sales again, trying to just get my head around at how to look at that line item before consolidation comes in Q3. So, bringing in some of the production in-house, obviously you saw the decline from about -- I think it was around $250 million last quarter down to $85,000 this quarter. I understand that it only incorporates the tail end of March there. But what’s the best way to look at the magnitude of what you’re potentially able to run at, given your in-house capacity now? Are you -- magnitudes higher than where you were in Q4 on a go forward basis or where does your in-house capacity sit?"
Afzal Hasan,1,"Yes. So, this is Afzal. Thanks for your question. The answer for that question is, it’s a little bit multifaceted. What you’ve seen on our financial statements is a few days worth of revenue of products that were sold at the end of that quarter but production was going on through the close of the month. We had -- I think, we’d announced at some point in December a few large sales that we had made just before our initial [ph] production. So, what we aim to do is load up our distributors with products so that we are able to have a smooth transition from one manufacturing facility to the other.
On your question about what the revenue rate is going to look like, I would highlight that we have taken on a number of brands since Q4 that includes Bhang chocolate, Bhang edibles and also production of our own brands that are included over there too. So, you should see substantial growth over there compared to what our own in-house product sales were because we have a number of other products on the shelves. And you can also take a look at how Alta has been doing with some of the numbers that we put out information about how they have been doing with the distributor in the month of April which was quite well compared to their historical performance. So, we are confident that we are going to see a fair amount of growth into the future on both categories."
Matt Bottomley,1,"Just last question on the quarter. The royalty margin, just curious on what’s driving pressure there. I don’t know if it’s an accounting thing or what. But just curious, the margin the last few quarter has been coming down, I think negative this quarter. Is there a particular reason or a fundamental reason for that?"
Francois Perrault,1,"Yes. Hey Matt, it’s Francois. You hit it. It’s an accounting thing. It’s tied to the River royalty. We continued to make investments on -- if you recall, the River royalty is a $5 million investment and we’ve concluded these $5 million in this quarter. And for accounting reasons, we had to go and retro the amortization all the way back to the beginning of the royalty, which was May. So, there’s sort of a one-time catch-up and the amortization on that royalty. And just so you understand, this may not be intuitive either the amortization on a royalty investment because it’s a fixed term investment, goes into cost of sales. So, the one-time catch-up was the regular amortization, was enough put the River royalty margin into negative territory."
Matt Bottomley,1,"Okay. So, is it fair to assume it will normalize as of Q2?"
Francois Perrault,1,That’s a very fair assumption. Yes.
Matt Bottomley,1,"And then, just so I don’t take up all the time here, really quickly, just on some of the more fundamental things we are seeing in California. Maybe if you can just give your color on two things for me. One is, obviously the acquisitions you did between the three that were highlighted at the beginning of call I think have a trailing run rate or trailing revenues of about $45 million. I am just curious what magnitude of growth you’re seeing going into 2018 and how much of that is tied to just the California market trying to open up in terms of its new regulations, and if you’re expecting any speed bumps there? And then, the last question will just be, do you have any plans for getting into the dispensary side of things whether you know wholly-owned dispensaries or partnering more with some of these California dispensaries that are starting to get -- brought into the regulations? And I’ll leave it there. Thanks."
Afzal Hasan,1,"Yes, for sure. So, to take your first question about how we see the future ramping up and I’d go back to response for the question I just delivered just a moment ago with all the sales having reached on record levels in April, we think we’re quite well-positioned to feed more growth into the rest of the year. The speed bumps and the majority of them actually happened at the beginning of this year when the market went to reset on Jan 1st. On Jan 1st, there were about maybe a hundred and change licensed retailers that distributors could actually sell through to. So that was likely going to be the most negative or constricted time in the history of this market that you see for a licensed distributor, manufacturer, retailer. And since then, things have improved dramatically. So, we saw close to 500 licensed retailers in the state only lasted a check handful of weeks ago. And that number has been growing quite significantly. Just for context as well, last year, we estimated there was close to a 1,500 licensed retailers across the state and about the equal number, another 1,500 in illegal retailers too. So, our hope and expectation is that the legal market will grow into that same size and scale as it had before. And with that growth, we should see pretty significant increases with the distribution sales that we have through Alta which in turn feeds the demand for our own in-house brands and products. So that’s a lens into what the future holds for us.
And I’m sorry, you had a second part of the question."
Matt Bottomley,1,"Yes, apology. Just if you have any plans -- or what your view is on the economics of potentially getting into the dispensary side of things in the value chain in California as more and more of those are brought into the regulated or the new regs, I should say?"
Afzal Hasan,1,"Yeah. So for us, we’ve been looking to support our downstream dispensary partners, but it’s a careful competitive choice that we have made. A dispensary is unique asset class that you’re dealing. With the dispensary, you have a unique retail location. There is a fixed maximum on what you can do through that retail location. So for us looking for these types of explosive growth that the market is expecting, investing into that type of an asset class isn’t the consistent really with our use of capital and what the expectations are for us as a company and the growth that we want to develop. So, because of that we’ve made a pretty cold and calculated move to stay outside of the retail sector and instead work to support our downstream retailers by both creating products and programs that support them as well as in some cases most recently announced an actual financial investment into retailer, and in that case, there was actually a delivery service. So we see a lot of potential in that space and we’re trying to support our downstream partners, but it’s not the type of platform that we’re looking to develop and we’re instead just looking for work and partner with them."
Operator,1,[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Keith Carpenter with AltaCorp Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Keith Carpenter,1,"I don’t have a question specifically to the results; I hope those were in line. So, I have a couple of questions on go forward. The first was, do you have any updated timeline? It sounded in your MD&A that River, I think you had said you expect to close summer. If you can talk about specifically when you think River closes as well as FloraCal, any update on that?"
Afzal Hasan,1,"Yes, absolutely. So FloraCal is in a pretty advanced state of closing. We’re in the process of finalizing documentation and completing final due diligence. So, we’d expect that to close within weeks. And that should be something we’re able to put into the market pretty soon. River is something that we are taking the right pace on. It’s a very complicated integration, exercise that we are undergoing with River and Alta. And we want to make sure that there’s no interruption at the sales channel for either one of those two companies. So, we have engaged several advisors that are actually working with us on pretty advanced timelines and processes to get these things towards closing. Our estimate for closing is a little bit later than what we had originally predicted. So, we are targeting into the month of July at this point."
Keith Carpenter,1,You guys alluded in the press release that you -- of expected progress in Canada over the course of 2018. Can you comment on all that may involve?
Afzal Hasan,1,"Yes, absolutely. I mean, we have been taking a look at Canada for quite some time. If you take a look at what our future progression and direction is, we are looking to leverage this growing stable of brands that we either have or worked with in California into other jurisdictions. And for a variety of reasons, Canada seems to be the right choice for us to use as a second step for that evolution and progression. One of the unique things that Canada offers is, is the ability to potentially have global export. I think, this is something that a lot of players have seized upon. And it is an offset [ph] us -- on us at all that -- and one of the downsides of operating U.S. market despite being the places where we think the rents are going to grow is that they are restrictive from moving products across state lines.
So, in order to unlock the capability of the platform that we are developing, we have decided to focus more on Canada. We have been involved in active discussions with a variety of different players that are in the market to both better understand the market and how we can play in it, and also figure out what the timing would be for us to get involved in. One of the things that we are trying to avoid is, it’s coming in too early with the market that can’t really support the products that we are looking to put out there. So, if we try to go into the markets today, our ability to compete on the basis that we believe the markets need to compete on would be very limited by the regulations. So, it is going to come hand-in-hand with our progression and evolution of market but we are making plans to be there when the time is right for our products."
Keith Carpenter,1,Is there a leaning one way or the other at this time that you would be doing licensing or JV-ing with someone or both?
Afzal Hasan,1,"We are exploring all opportunities at this point. There’s upsides and downsides and the reality is that we might actually take a few different tracks depending on the intellectual property or brand or products. If we find the right product for certain class of products, that might actually dictate how we choose to have it developed and put into the Canadian market. So, you might see a variety of approaches from us because at this point we are exploring a number of different types of options."
Keith Carpenter,1,"Okay, great. Two quick questions, I’d say, you guys had -- and Afzal, you had commented on this previously, you were talking about your sales increase realized at both River -- soon to be closed River but through April, and Alta as well. As a general comment, does the growth in revenues trend also translate to your own manufactured products in April specifically and have you seen a continued growth in your manufacturing distribution business in May, as a general comment?"
Afzal Hasan,1,"Yes. So, we have seen pretty robust sales trends. April is a seasonally high month for the industry as they coincide with one of the biggest festivals or celebrations, the 4/20 celebration. So that is seasonally one of the highest months. We have been seeing pretty robust demand in May that hasn’t fallen off. And one of the major factors is that we just continually see more stores being added. So, we have a new store added almost every week on to our platform. And that’s something that is driving a fair amount of growth sequentially as we progress through the year. That is something on your question about the manufacturing too. The best way to probably think it is to see that our manufacturing is more or less rising, or projected to rise proportionally with our distribution at least in the initial stages. So, as we’re able to access more outlets, there’s more places that we can place our own products as well as the products of other companies. And so you should see scale increase for both our products as well as the distribution platform hand in hand over the next few quarters."
Keith Carpenter,1,"Okay, great. And as a final question, again, you talked about this just previously, but on your -- we know how the dispensaries as a market came down in Q1 and you’re seeing them ramp higher. And I’m assuming there is quite a lot of new faces out there, for a lack of better term. Can you discuss your efforts or River’s to connect with those dispensaries? Do you have a team in place that goes and does that and you’re finding that you’re going as planned with regards to adding those to your downstream base?"
Afzal Hasan,1,"Yes, absolutely. Between River and Alta, we have almost 25 sales people that are roaming the state from north to south. And it’s something that is critical part of being a distributor and that’s why we have such a large sales force. And that sales force is actually designed to be able to accommodate the future demand that we expect of the state. And as it’s ramping up right now, what you’re seeing is that they’re knocking on doors daily. So, we’re attacking that problem quite seriously in terms of making sure that we’re on top of every licensed retailer outlet that’s coming out. And it’s a proposition that where it’s becoming easier and easier sale to the actual retailers, as they start to see the advantage is that a distributor can bring to them through consolidated ordering, reliability and also just having certainty about what they’re going to be getting in the product mix. That’s something that’s relatively easy sale to a retailer once they’ve started to use the platform [indiscernible] and in fact with other retailers as well which has been the case for us."
Operator,1,[Operator Instructions] Next question comes from Adam Altberg with BMO Nesbitt Burns. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Adam Altberg,1,"Hi. Really good questions this morning. Matt had some good stuff and covered off some of my questions. What I wanted to touch on and that last gentleman sort of touched on, and Afzal you touched on it as well was, can you talk to what were the number of dispensaries that Alta and River -- if you are allowed to talk about River yet, what were the number of dispensaries that they were servicing up to December 31 of 2017? And that reset basically on Jan 1, what number are you at or what number are they at now, and how that obviously ties into the fact that as you said Alta reported record sales?"
Afzal Hasan,1,"Yes, absently. Thanks for questions. So, to provide a little bit of color on this one. As of last year, as I’ve mentioned, we estimated that the dispensary market was about 1,500 dispensaries. Between Alta and River, we ran the analysis at that point, and they were covering the vast majority. So, it was north of a 1,000, south of 1,500. And that puts you into the 60, 70 plus percentage coverage range and in some cases higher depending on what time you evaluated that. We’ve seen a similar trend actually in terms of the coverage as we’ve got into this year. Both of them have been able to maintain the proportionate share over the market. So that’s the level of coverage that we have been able to maintain and our goal is to obviously continue to increase that as more dispensaries come on line. So, as of this point, you’d see that the dispensary market is about 500 licensed dispensaries. You’d roughly be expecting about the same percentage in that 60 to 70 percentage range, being accessed at any given point by River and Alta. At least right now we expect that number to only increase in terms of coverage over time."
Adam Altberg,1,"And just if you could talk about the process overall just in California because the last caller, it sounded like -- I don’t want to -- just presumptuous but it sounded like maybe you didn’t fully understand the process and the licensing differential between grow, distribution and dispensary, it sounded like since Jan 1, maybe there’s an assumption there that people are just able to open up willy-nilly and that I believe is not the case, in fact I think it’s the inverse, but maybe if you could just talk about that licensing component?"
Afzal Hasan,1,"Yes, absolutely. It’s a really interesting question that gets into really the California system and how it operates. And what I would tell you is that there is a number of different license classes that people are found to be relatively easy to obtain. So, those are more on the industrial and out of the way type of uses. So, when you’re talking about a large cultivation site or manufacturing center, distribution centers, these are things that cities and communities are more willing to accept because they see their resemblance and the things that they are accustomed to. And there’s really no overt effect on the community when you have that kind of an industrial presence inserted from the cannabis industry.
Retail is actually one of the trickiest ones, and that’s where we’ve seen the most difficulties in the market because it inherently involves a very, very local community focused decision. And that is something that’s been quite challenging for people to penetrate into because there are some local communities that have been almost in a deadlock around actually granting retail licenses. So, despite the fact that we’ve seen a massive amount of licenses awarded in California, last count I’ve seen about over 6,000 actually that were awarded through the course of these -- the last five and a half or six months or so. That’s primarily been another license classes and dispensaries, as I mentioned we are looking at about 500 or so that actually have come on line. I think that presents a tremendous opportunity for sure because there is going to be a lot of growth in that retail sector. But, it’s quite a challenging one and one that presents road blocks that many haven’t been able to navigate. And the south of California in particular has been quite notoriously tight for issuing these licenses and that is something that we know the State of California is working for remedy and health of the local communities too, but it presents a rocky road in the near term.
Our ability to bear that is thankfully a little bit diversified or quite diversified because we’re working across the state with all the repos that are coming on line. So, we are not tied to any particular locale or geography that might be more problematic."
Adam Altberg,1,"Right. And so, in the end, the licensing to have retail point of distribution is completely separate from distribution license such as Alta and River?"
Afzal Hasan,1,"100%. Yes. So, each of them follows an individual track. What you’d see as a process for any type of license in California is that you’re going to need to work with your local jurisdiction first. They are going to need to approve the use of whatever lands or property that you’re going to be using in your business. And the process is generally quite straightforward for some of these simple uses on the industrial side, so again manufacturing and distribution. So, it’s often quite straightforward because it’s just need to be in the right zoning area. The retail process -- retail clearance process can be quite challenging. And there are quotas as well, keep that in mind too for every jurisdiction. So, every jurisdiction that’s out there has either an explicit or an implicit quota that they’ve been operating on. And that also presents some hurdles when you want apply for retail license. Once you get that license, you then go over to the states in order to get your full state license. That we don’t expect to be as much of a road block but we’re seeing that most people having been able to clear that local license hurdle in the retail sector very successfully today."
Adam Altberg,1,"Got it. Okay, just a couple of other questions. I know the previous two guys were asking about or trying to pick a way and to get some forward guidance expectations. Do you guys have any plans once obviously we’ll call it the best settles, River closes and so on, do you guys have any plans? It sounds like maybe two, three quarters down the road to potentially give some type of forward guidance, both on top line and on your margins?"
Marc Lustig,1,"Thanks, Adam. It’s Marc. I think we’d love to get there for sure. I think, we’re probably the most excited guys to be able to look towards quarter two and quarter three, and frankly going forward once, River and FloraCal have been closed. Our opportunity pipeline in terms of other things that we’re looking at has never been richer. So, that process will continue which would make guidance tricky. But certainly at the outset, I think we’ve tried to make it clear that when investors look at the Q2 and Q3 numbers and see how these transactions as part of the platform, it’s going to be a lot more exciting, but also probably a lot easier to start to figure out what the numbers were or numbers are. I would tell you this that I’m not providing any guidance here. But it’s certainly a corporate objective of ours to leave 2018 on a $100 million exit rate. And that would be once you’ve included all of the different acquisitions that we’ve spoken about already, plus adding just basic organic growth rate. And again, I stress that’s our objective and I think when people start seeing the following quarters become very clear in terms of where we’re going."
Adam Altberg,1,And is that Canadian or U.S. and what type of margin expectation would that involve as well?
Marc Lustig,1,"First of all, I’ll say Canadian. And I think we commented several times on just seeing very robust increase in margins going forward."
Adam Altberg,1,"Okay, great. And last question for you guys. There has been a number of announcements or highlighted I guess we should say around JVs with various beverage companies. I don’t recall seeing anything from you guys. Is there anything potentially on the horizon or -- anyways, I’ll just leave that issue around beverages. Thank you."
Marc Lustig,1,"Yes, for sure. Thanks, Adam. Beverages are one of the most unique product classes that are out there. We have an extremely strong interest in that product category, which is exactly the reason why we have not yet executed on anything. To-date we have assessed over 20 different companies in technologies in that space. We see a lot of ups and downs. And what I’d highlight for you is that the beverage category is really unique and different from the typical cannabis product categories where you might typically look at a cannabis product and what actually fascinates and drives a lot of sales momentum in this industry is the unique high value aspect of the cannabis products. So for example, if you take a jar of flowers that FloraCal sells for anywhere from $60 plus which contains 3.5 grams, you’re talking about a handful of something that actually costs you $60. And so the economics of moving that around and selling it are quite attractive for somebody.
If you think of beverage on the other hand, a beverage is going to be actually larger than that jar of flower and cost an iota of what it costs, so beverage that if you want to really be selling on to market may be $5 or $10 for serving is you’d be looking at. That is -- it’s a fractionate, less than a tenth of the value of that equivalent product. So, when you start to think about the logistics of it, it presents a very different challenge for a product manufacturer, which is precisely the reason why you haven’t seen beverages explode yet in the market. It’s not quite as lucrative for people when they’re seeking a high margin and high return.
What I would point to you though is that beverages are inherently just dependent on distribution. And when you start to take a look at it, the cost of logistics and transporting that large high volume, low value in comparison to the other types of cannabis products -- type of product, they are inherently well suited for actually having scalable and very efficient distribution. And so, this is no surprise really for us and it’s not an accident that we are developing our distribution platform because we do see immense opportunities in that space. And we believe the best way to leverage it is to actually have the infrastructure that allows for that market to develop because it doesn’t really exist yet in most jurisdictions."
