Marc Dubreuil,0,"Welcome to you one and all. We're meeting here to take a look at the Remy Cointreau Group First Half Results as of the 30 September.
Of course you already know our growth in sales. You know that for us, we're not looking for volume growth. We're much more interested in value growth. You've already seen these figures. We're very pleased with the growth we've had of 7.7% organic and even more importantly, 8.9% of our brands.
And an important event today I mentioned growth in our current operating profit, you know that this year in the first half versus last year first half, we had some headwinds, nevertheless you can look at the very good operating profit.
The first thing was the drop in the dollar in the first half of the previous financial year that had real impact on us. You know that we're very exposed to drop in the dollar or an increase in the dollar, once our hedges had expired and then our second possible impediment to growth in operating profit and this is intentional, we made a strategic decision while back now to strongly increase our communications spending, which is that we're very proud of the organic growth we see here 10.1% double-digit growth yet again.
I'd remind you that over the past three years, our profit has grown by 33% and so logically in terms of what I said earlier, our current operating margin has continued growing -- it's percentage has grown organically 0.6 points after IFRS. Luca will be explaining the difference to you once again of course in a moment; organic growth of 326.2%.
Now the net profit group share, earnings per share, all of these results grew somewhat less than the current operating income -- current operating profit. All this will be explained to you in detail of course in a moment, but importantly to bear in mind, the difference in the percentage of growth is absolutely not in any way negative in terms of our overall financial standing -- financial health and you can see this clearly because our debt continues to melt like snowflakes in the sun, the net debt over EBITDA ratio is now 1.17. This we feel is very much of record figure,
I'd like to give the floor now to Valérie Chapoulaud Floquet, our CEO, who will be talking to you about the Group's business and then the CFO, Luca Marotta will give you do further explanation about the financial results. Afterwards as is our custom, we will be pleased to field any questions you might have."
Valérie Chapoulaud Floquet,0,"Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Marc. To talk to you about our business review in the first half, you've already gotten the sales figures a few days ago, but Luca will be talking to you more specifically about the income statement and earnings.
In the first half, the takeaway point, we can say it's a positive half yearly period, very much in line with our expectations and to our budget. First of all great growth in our business, topline activity, i.e. sales as Marc arguably said, we're best in two things, first of all growth in our group owned brands, 9% organic. That's very good performance, very much in line with our expectations.
We'll see in a few moments the breakout of volume versus value, very favorable and also very much in line with what we intend to do, but in terms of your long meeting term in this group.
Now let's give a summary overview of the first half detail in a moment putting by geography and brand and houses. Basically our growth we can say continues to be very strong in Asia Pacific. I know that you have any questions regarding China. Everyone in the industry and especially in our area, there has good growth there, also in Americas, the great growth in both areas.
I'd remind you the US is the number one country first in the region, we'll look at that in a moment, further confirmed, we're very pleased with our overall growth in the group. ENEA [ph] which is a huge cost very mix of countries, you've got the key countries that are doing very well, that's very much good news, some countries you have by heart such as Western Europe continues to be more complicated nevertheless in areas where we have the potential group of business activities are doing very well.
Let's talk about earnings and profits and this is the third first half running that we've seen growth simplified in China. You can get these figures. Two years ago our growth was around 7%, almost 12% last year and then 10% organic growth this year.
As you can see, it's very much continuity, very important and reassuring up 10% if we look at the current operating profit, 10% growth organic this half year period. Several factors relating here, no major surprise, It's a good thing though because it shows long-term confirmation. We're seeing growth in our gross margin very important this year especially we'll see this in detail.
You've got the mix effect, price mix effect, which is major. Business combination of several things, I'll give you further detail. So this is further confirmation over time. This has already begun yielding very positive results last year, even more, it's even more the case this year.
Of course we're continuing to keep our overhead under control both centrally and also in the markets. Another very important point, we've very much supported and maintained our investments over the months sometimes there might be adjustments it wasn’t the case in the first half. So the major investments had a quicker pace in growth in revenue.
This will be even picking up further in the second half, an important phenomenon and again a big impact in direct particularly in certain countries and regions that are fundamental in our luxury brands such as LOUIS XIII.
Current operating margin up in a regular fashion organically in the first half up 0.6 points. Overall net profit up strongly organically by 7.2%. As you can see here, we got the bridge between last year and this year, the currency effect, Luca will come back to that point. We can say that this is a little less, the currency effect we would expect it, we explained already that the first half might well be complicated and really not only, but mainly due to the dollar, but in the end, the current effect is a little bit lesser than we had expected. So that's pretty much piece of good news.
If we look at this growth by business line, you know that we've got Cognac elements of the group. There is gap that's fairly interesting difference and this will be rebalance on the second half for many of the reasons. We've got great growth, double-digit almost plus 12% for Cognac, which is growth if we look at that by market for Cognac, we're talking mainly about the U.S., Asia including China of course plus several European countries, sort of growing above market. So we're gaining market share in value and we're gaining market share in that respect.
Very good news, you can tell me that's your growth is [indiscernible] because Cognac is doing well worldwide, that's material. We're growing faster than market. We're outpacing market growth and that's good news.
Liquors and spirits, we can say that their phasing phenomena here, we invested well in the first half. We've got good visibility in the second half. We can say, we're quite confident there will be rebalancing. So the blend of several items here and so fourth. We'll see further detail in all the regional element.
Partner brands, no big surprises since as you know, we wish to working with our brands. You realize four years ago our partner brands made up around 15% of our sales and currently it's standing at around 8%. You to trend further confirmed. There was negative growth, slight negative growth of 5% which is intentional. Some technical effects, but this will smooth out over the second half of the year.
When we look at other phase down by region and division, the major proportion in this half year period, the growth gaining two points 70% of our sales. So if you look at the regions, no big surprises. We're comfortable with this balance.
The Americas 40% but as you can see clear turnaround in Asia Pacific uptick five years ago, remember five six years ago, Asia-Pacific was under one region after the crisis in China and strong growth, so double-digit basically for five years in the Americas. The Americans now have become the number one region. We're very comfortable with this balance. Presumption of Asia is a pretty logical really.
Now if we look at the same geography broken down by house, no big surprises here either, makes perfect sense, considering growth and this growth isn’t just in the Americas but Asia's growth is substantially higher than the Americas. We can talk about that later.
Asia-Pacific looking good again for Remy Martin. We like this balance. Liquor and spirits now, fewer effects due to the proportion of Europe. Making about 50% for liquor and spirits, so less of a rebalancing effect to be found in this product area.
To talk about current operating profit, now look at the bridge important point a couple of effects here as we just saw a moment ago, but we are interested in what's important to us and what we like very much is something we're quite pleased with actually. In one sense this balance price mix, volume mix you can see in this half year period and we'll see this throughout the year, the volume mix and price mix situation with a lot of phenomena that are coming together at the same time.
The rebalancing and the geography, we just talked about this obvious as Asia, price positioning is higher, that's a plus, but it's not only coming from that. We've also got higher quality and brand positioning is higher, which are doing well, that's a plus for us but most importantly, there is a price effect, which is quite substantial.
Some brands increased quite significantly starting the fiscal period 1 April, maybe [indiscernible] fashion in the past. The second price hike in the brand Remy Martin in the United States which is second half, which is to say there is greater momentum in prices, which is to say there is greater momentum in prices, which is doing quite well.
It varies from one country or region to another in Europe, much more complicated as you know. Nevertheless I can say it's been quite uniform in the half-year period. It's a combination of three factors geography, increase in prices and price mix and brand.
Very good effect. Volume doing well, and as you can see advertising and communications investments played an important role in the first half.
Net profit now, no major comments here. You can see the net profits excluding nonrecurring items up 7%, organic up 6%, and net profit group share, no main changes here. Luca will come back to the point.
Let's talk about the houses, news and reported stuff. House of Rémy Martin saw great balance in terms of overall sales, vary versus volumes very buoyant growth, House of Rémy Martin same growth in the first half and Greater China, Asia generally, Greater China, Japan and Southeast Asia.
Greater China, everybody is particular interested because of the presence of Cointreau and so forth. Growth is very significant. We see no fault on whatsoever so far, we can talk about that. This is equally true for all of Southeast Asia especially Singapore which is a major market and will showcase for the world in for Asia.
Japan as I mentioned starting the year very, very well. In Travel Retail, Asia-Pacific also playing its role well which is also looking good again the customer base, consumers in Asia-particularly China, you know the Chinese now going to this airport stores and the momentum is shifting and its shifting in our direction.
The America's great growth outpacing the marketplace, very good growth in [Cointreau] but also several other group brands were also interested to see the - basically we’re an interesting player at the high end of every segment. I’ll remind you for a few years we were announcing that we would be addressing the portion about $50 and it’s an interesting thing for us, for instance in the U.S. country very much market country but we can see pretty clearly is in all segments as it is happening.
If you look at, for instance the rum category. Rum overall has seen negative growth in the U.S. but the high end rum is growing strongly. Basically the stretch that we - had imagined is taking place in all the segments in the U.S. and particular we’re positioned in terms of the high and high range qualities in all segments of these categories.
Europe now, and EMEA. There is sub-hubs and very different countries. Some of the performance necessarily is contrasting like is the case for everyone, no major surprises, mix performance, specifically important countries that are doing very well, so just the U.K., Russia, the Middle East and India. More complicated countries you can imagine in Western Europe, Continental Europe their performances are quite unequal.
Now, news and some pictures here, some important pieces of news that continue to be important to us. First of all limited edition in ARt, with Matt Moore. This is widely successful and especially helped us really make a clear statement, a very clear - clever visual statement high impact, very well covered in all the countries, very successfully objective was to seek out younger customers and appeal to contemporary customers.
This is a good job of bringing new customers in terms of building to help now, the House of Rémy Martin starting a few years ago, the initiative in London, the U.K., The House of Rémy Martin taken over by some of the big countries and we are continuing the same model or have a very high event covering several days. We did it in China but we are too further in this year, in China, Chengdu first. The second one being in Moscow. In Moscow we fine-tuned upgrading the quality even further appealing to the influencers of the customers we’re very interested in.
The U.K. started this four years ago wanted to evolve the concept to go to London, do go to visit - I am sure you’re all familiar with visit the ground floor where for a month - for a year, sorry, we've had a permanent presence of the House of Rémy Martin, it’s a location and a place where we can meet with our customers and potential customers, so we can discover Rémy Martin and we can also help them discover several other group products.
So Rémy Martin is just - now Louis XIII, a year ago we launched the second campaign, 100 years campaign. The campaign was updated a year ago with very successful launch in Shanghai. We're continuing with these events in all of our markets to receive top-quality events that took place throughout the world is Singapore, Toronto, London to share here with you many others.
This is where we invite our customers - potential customers and stakeholders to come discover Louis XIII, to understand the position in, to understand what makes it unique and its true luxury positioning.
So great initiatives worldwide in all the markets. We've also got a lot of interaction with customers on Louis XIII. We know many of them individually. We've also brought that interaction further forward such as Louis [indiscernible] website where you can very easily in all the countries you travel to discover the various possibilities of discovering Louis particularly in non-trade.
Hence the bridge for [indiscernible] we saw the group bridge I said you earlier the mix - price mix effect is quite substantial also that the volume effect but especially the price mix effect is substantial. Investments continue in the house and markets. Organic growth €13 million and little over 11%.
Liqueurs & Spirits a little bit more of a mix in the half years, several decisions were taken, nothing new here though. One big new thing is starting the fiscal period with a new Cointreau campaign. Unfortunately, it can't be viewed in France but has been rolled out to all other markets particularly the long-standing market such as the U.S.
There is an investment phase for the health Cointreau is very much a beautiful brand needs to be slightly polished and continues shining beautifully. The campaign has done very, very well for Cointreau, now it's up to us to continue supporting there over time and repeat it.
We're expecting further effects in the second half. In the long-standing markets, things are doing well. Cointreau is in the [indiscernible] overall volume tend be dipping down but we are doing very well in the market to create in value terms so we're doing well.
In market such as United States and the U.K. we are very confident, things are going well, we’re gaining market shares. Now new markets we talked about this previously China and Russia, we radically changed our strategy there just over 2 years ago with a significant growth there now, very encouraging for the future. Appealing to new customers particularly in cocktails, which is very much our positioning. That also means more significant nontrade positions in bars, hotels and restaurants.
Now Metaxa, great start of the year. You know we've upscaled Metaxa, our priority has been the 12 stars this is doing very particularly in the new market China which we've moved into about a year ago. Reposition, we’ll talk about this later but Metaxa repositioned particularly in tender bars and mixology. This is a new attack which is doing very, very well and we're continuing to boost that, speed it up.
We're up scaling further might be little more complicated but all in all, we can say that strategy is very clear and will be beneficial in the future. Mount Gay, clearly the brand that we’re repositioning now. We’ll talk about this further, I suspect maybe 6, 12 months down the road, lots of things are underway work in progress.
Mount Gay for the timing isn't the bread that’s helping move forward in liquids and spirits. On that end, The Botanist while they are successful, our vision was to 2 June brand in the high-end segment. We are winning that wager in a big way uniformly throughout the world.
It's phenomenal. People have realized this for quite some time now. When you have people test The Botanist liquid to lips as it's called, basically the success rate is 100%. So, although we’re able to test, like it, buy it. That's very, very important and I think we’ll continue speeding up phenomenally successful.
Whiskies doing well also. You may have seen the launch of Port Charlotte, our which is well received in all the markets. Reasons starting this fall or summertime between a region. All in all, all of our whiskies are very well, Westland for the time being mainly North America and France historic market.
Two interesting initiatives I mentioned here earlier relaunch, this is the global visual of the Cointreau campaigns. We are taking cocktails again Margarita Cointreau, this is a main ingredient in the Margarita when it was originally designed, so we are taking the Margarita back. It's important - the biggest most widely consumed cocktail worldwide.
Let's come along this. The relaunch of Port Charlotte with a campaign - campaign advertisement whisky this is visual a lot of particularly digitally, great positioning, very clear, fairly original, very successful - clearly, and we continue to position the three brands in Scotland in a very distinctive way.
Here's a bridge for Liqueurs & Spirits, so you can see that the mix price effect more complicated in this category. First of all, this is more in Europe which is little more complicated. Furthermore this is the product for the time being are quite well positioned in that category, so less elasticity in terms of pricing partner brands, no surprise as I said to you. There is a downtick, but it was intended more the down in volume than value let’s say.
There is one - couple of phenomenon right numbers. First of all, halting distribution of Campari. Campari wanted to change partner in the Czech Republic and Slovakia back over in the right direction because that's also we intended in the future. They took over as their autonomy [indiscernible].
Another hand, we continue the distribution of Russian standard. We were the global partner for Travel Retail Russian standard to the group we organized in Travel Retail particularly in Europe and we couldn’t continue distribution so there is lot of Russian standard left us on April 1.
The scope effect isn’t entirely like for like. There is a small operation which was done in the second half of the year - second quarter of the U.S. will be sold some inventory that we still hit in our warehouses, slight technical effect there. But all in all, for other partner brands that we distribute mainly in Europe but we consider momentum is really pretty good.
So we can see the results here. This is the strategic choice in the partner brands that aren't part of our operating profit. This is a small portion here, good news we're stepping back but there is no major effect on the group in terms of current operating profit.
I’ll hand over to Luca, who will give you the details now on all these figures that you've been given in very summary fashion so far. Thank you."
Luca Marotta,0,"Thank you, Valérie.
We're now going to move on a detailed analysis of the financial statements. As you know as of April 1, the Remy Cointreau Group has started applying the IFRS 15, 16 and 9 standards. However in order to allow us to compare and analyze our 2018 figures as against 2017, our comments will relate to the pro forma figures before the roll-in of the new accounting norms. Then we'll have a look at our post IFRS reported figures.
So let's start with the income statement. Based on organic sales growth of 7.7%, current operating profit was up 10.1 on an organic basis would show basically corresponds to an organic increase of 0.6 in our current operating margin. This solid performance so was once again mainly driven by gross margin growth of 9.1% year-on-year on an organic basis therefore more than the sales outpacing gross. Thanks to positive leverage of volumes and mix and also especially this year thanks to notable prices increases all over the world.
Strong momentum in sales and gross margin thus allowed us to fund a further significant increase in sales and marketing expenses that are up 8.9% in the half year on an organic basis broken down into two components. Firstly, we have investments in communication, advertising, PR, digital and media and promotional expenses in the field up 9.5% in the half year on an organic basis which outpaces sales growth by around 25%.
Among these A&P investments, it’s the above the line part i.e. classic, media, digital and PR that was up in solid double digit growth while the below the line segment on premise activation was up by a high single-digit.
Secondly, distribution cost good double digits on an organic basis. As already mentioned, we're talking here about investment to strengthen the depth and diversify our route to market with two key areas and focus developing direct distribution of high-end Cointreau stores and e-commerce and direct sales force, and other ways of getting our distributor partners to adapt to our brand elevation strategy.
Finally our administrative expenses are well under control and up 5.1% on an organic basis. All in all, our current operating profit was up 10.1% on an organic basis, on a reported basis it was up to 2.9% after taking into account adverse currency effects. Nevertheless then we feared in June, 13 million over half year.
Okay, let's move on to the analysis of the group's current operating margin which fell 0.5 percentage points to 24.1% over the half year. This breakdowns into organic growth of 0.6 points and an adverse currency effect of 1.1. There was no scope effect this year contrary to last year.
The organic improvement of the current operating margin was driven as expected by notable increase in the gross margin and a slight decrease in the ratio of distribution cost enabling us to observe an increase in the A&P ratio. Let's look at these various items.
First of all, the 0.9 uplift in the gross margin was driven as mentioned earlier by positive product mix, and country effects, thanks to the outperformance of our high end portfolio from product perspective and of Greater China from a market perspective. However, this year particular was also driven by the significant price effect across all world regions.
Secondly, the modest 0.1% improvement in the ratio of distribution costs was mainly down to strict control over holding company cost which helped to offset high-end distribution and branding cost. And thirdly, the A&P expense ratio increased by 0.4%. As you know, management is really keen to step up investment in brand building to help move our brand portfolio up market and drive significant organic growth does helping achieve the group's profitability targets.
Let's now take a look at the rest of the income statement beginning with other operating income which totaled €2 million mainly consisting of gains and disposal of non-core assets. Financial costs increased to 19.6 million in half year driven by two factors, one nonrecurring and the other non-cash, I'll come back to this in greater detail in the later side.
Our tax rate rose from 27.9% to 29% due to changes in our geographical mix over the whole of 2018/2019 all things being equal we are still expecting a tax rate of around 30%.
There has been very little change in the associates and minorities lines with amounts close to zero. Let me simply note that the group's investment in the Chinese wine company dynasty had no impact over the period. The situation remains unchanged with our investment valued at €13.5 million as of September 30, 2018 which is equivalent to the value of HK$0.36. This is equivalent to the value posted 30 September, 2017 and 31 March, 2018. In other words, no impact whatsoever on our income statement.
The net profit attributable to the group does came in at €85.4 million down 4.3% year-on-year but excluding nonrecurring items, net profit came in at €87.5 million down 3.1% but up 7.2% on an organic basis as net margin excluding nonrecurring items thus comes in at 15.3% in the half-year and at 60.5% in organic terms.
Now let's look at the reconciliation table between net profit and net profit excluding nonrecurring items. Nonrecurring items amounted to €2.1 million in the first half and all-in-all are a negative item. There are two key factors that explain this.
On the one hand, we had a 2.1 million gain mainly related to the disposal of non-core assets for €2 million and then we had a 5.2 million nonrecurring expense linked to early repayment of the vendor alone by the EPI Group that corresponds to the difference between the amount repaid and the balance sheet value of the loans, there is difference mainly corresponds to insurance due on the loan by virtue it's having been repaid early because as a reminder this vendor loan was due to be repaid in July 2020. In total this is a €3.2 million accumulated charge that comes down to €2.1 million after-tax so that's what you see on the table here.
Now, let's hope to something that's very important especially if you think future of the company. Let's take a look at our post IFRS 15, 16 and 9 reported figures and the reconciliation between the pro forma pre-IFRS figures and the reported post IFRS figures over the first half.
Starting with IFRS 15 which applies to income from ordinary activities derived from contracts with customers. The main impact of our rolling out the norm is to reclassify some promotional expenses as deductions against sales, the amount thus reclassified in the half-year was €56.2 million of which $24.4 million deducted against sales and €11.8 million recognized as an additional cost of goods sold.
Now moving to IFRS 16 which covers leases. This mainly results an adjustments to the balance sheet with group leases totaling around €30 million now capitalized in noncurrent assets and a net debt. This has direct consequences on the profit and loss account. We’re going to have €0.3 million in additional depreciation under administrative expenses. And on the other side, €0.5 million increase in financial costs.
In other words this is tantamount to reducing our net result by €0.2 million but this is simply requalification without any actual impact on the bottom line. And finally a high lead technical change with the rollout of IFRS 9 which relates to financial instruments.
This change entails reclassifying the time value of foreign exchange options and forward hedges within our balance sheet and capital. The consequence of that is a pretax financial expense of €3.4 million that was reclassified as the balance sheet item in shareholder's equity of the net impact on net profit excluding nonrecurring item is therefore positive by €2.1 million, while our net debt to EBITDA ratio increases slightly by 0.04 percentage points.
If we now move to the next slide, we've tried to transcribe here the various items I just mentioned from the point of view of our current operating margin which is one of the most significant indicators for our company. So, if you look at Slide 27 you see, that the new IFRS norms have boosted our current operating margin by 2.1 points over the first half.
Our new current operating margin is there for 26.2%, as against 24.1% on a pro forma basis pre-IFRS. Also this 26.2% value is when you should use as a basis for your forecast of H1 2019/2020.
The main variances are as follow; the gross margin declined because of IFRS 15 by 5 points to be coming just below 62.5% as a result of some promotional expenses being reclassified as deductions against sales and an increase in cost of goods sold. Conversely, the A&P ratio is down by 7.6 points to 13.2% due to a number of such promotional expenses being reclassified as the deductions.
And finally, the distribution cost ratio rises - ratio has risen by a modest 0.5% to 23% due to a lower sales value while distribution costs have remained in absolute terms largely unchanged. In other words, this has been all-in-all a positive impact knowing that it's mainly IFRS 15 that has impact our figures whereas IFRS 16 and 9 have had an impact.
I would like to take this opportunity to remind you of the guidance we had published when last we met. We're expecting under five point decline in our gross margin and 8 point to decline in the A&P ratio, and one point increase in the distribution cost ratio.
In other words on a yearly bases, we're expecting an increase in our current operating margin of around 150 basis points as against the 200 basis points that had been announced. I wanted you to clearly understand the impact of our going by these new IFRS.
For September 30, 2018, our pro forma for reference, working capital reaches a seasonal peak in September. The key items to note are as follows. Firstly, there was a significant change in recurring operating cash flow over the half-year period. While they were a net cash generation of €6.9 million in H1 2017-2018, there were a net cash outflow of €101.9 million in the first half.
With EBITDA almost €5 million higher, this deterioration was mainly due to substantial variations in other components of working capital, representing a net outflow of the €100 million versus last year, mainly driven by phasing effect mostly related to trade receivable and our supplier parables.
We therefore expect a significant improvement in this item in H2, the deterioration in recurring operating cash flow also reflects an 8 million increase in CapEx mainly related to investment in manufacturing and IT capacity and a €7 million increase in finance cost.
The variation in finance cost mainly reflects the end of interest payments on the vendor loan by the EPR Group in H1 given it's early repayment, while cash interest received in this loan H1 last year totaled €5 million. Other cash outflows were more or less the same as last year. As far as the ODV [ph] and spirits working capital is concerned, the expected acceleration will take place in H2.
Non-operating cash flow was substantially positive over the first half for three main reasons. Dividend payments were down by around €16 million with 89% of shareholders opting to take their dividend in shares this year, compared with 70% last year.
The share buyback program started later than last year, resulting in a first half saving of €25 million. Conversely outflows in the second half will be higher. By last Monday, we had bought back 377,000 shares for a total of around €39 million.
Thirdly, the EPR Group repaid it's vendor loan early, generating an €86.8 million inflow. Overall with EBITDA higher and net debt lower, our net debt to EBITDA ratio continue to come down, falling from 1.66 times at September 2017 to 1.17 times at September 2018.
Now let's take a look at our net financial expenses, which was a charge of €19.6 million in H1 '18, '19, implying a €10.8 million increase versus last year's figure of €8.8 million. Now again there are two main factors explaining the increase, €10.8 million, first of all €3.5 million deterioration in net currency losses which is a non-cash charge and the second €7.5 million one-off impact related to the early repayment of the vendor loan €7.5 million year-on-year impact.
Firstly, let's start with more technical point. The non-cash net currency losses went from being an accounting gain of 0.7 million to a €2.7 million expense this year. For reference this very volatile item corresponds to the mark-to-market of the portfolio of currency hedging instruments. Under IFRS 9, it will henceforth disappear from the income statement and be recognized only in equity.
So for this year for 2018, '19, in order to ensure comparison with previous series, we will have the have this impact on the pro forma. In other words, this is a volatile variation that is very hard to forget. The second element is the early repayment of the vendor loan €86 million that at the P&L level had a €7.5 million, why so?
There is a nonrecurring €5.2 million expense corresponding as we've already said to the difference between the amount we paid and the loan's balance sheet value, that €5.2 million, but you shouldn’t forget that the nonpayment of interest of the vendor loan this year was we had to book €2.3 million in interest payments over the same year.
So the €5.2 will remain at that value but the €2.3 million will be doubled because when we move to full-year computation, so that will differential negative impact of about €10 million. Well, after having looked into these two non-recurrent for the first non-cash for the second effect on net financial expenses, we see that the growth financial debt by €0.4 million to €6.7 million and a lower average debt over the period, but also because the cost of debt has continued to drop.
Now our cost of debt stands at 1.17% knowing that all our long-term activities are at about seven year maturities. In other words, this is very important because we're moving towards the time value of our stock and it's very important for the future.
For fiscal 2018, 2019 after these very technical discussions, we are expecting our finance cost to increase due entirely to the early repayment of the vendor loan, nonrecurring expenses and the interest payment both 4.6, but you have to note that the net currency losses are as usual very unpredictable and will need to be recalculated at year-end but this is the last time that this nonrecurring items will appear in our accounts.
Okay. Now a very important element which is the impact of currency hedges, as mentioned earlier, the group reported adverse translation and transaction effects totaling €9.6 million in the first half. This impact was negative, but well below the original guidance of €13 million due to the US dollar having strengthen since the summer.
The average euro-dollar translation rate, the gray line came out at 1.18 over the half year as compared to 1.14 over the same period last year. Meanwhile the average hedge rate red line under our currency hedging policy, which is very cautious and absolutely non-speculative was 1.19 over the half-year compared with the 116 over the same period last year, which explains that we have such a small difference over the year, but €9.6 million as against the €13 million.
For fiscal 2018, 2019, we now expect an average hedge rate of 1.18 as compared with 1.23 as we had said in our previous guidance. Okay, what does mean on a yearly quantitative basis? We now expect a negative currency impact of around €3 million on sales compared with about 10 million according to our previous guidance and less than a million on current operating profit as compared to €17.7 million in our previous guidance. In other words this is better.
So if we assume an average translation rate of 1.6 over 2018, 2019, with a spot rate assumption of 1.14 over H2 and I show that this is an assumption at an average hedged rate of 1.18 over the whole full year 2018, 2019. So the impact on our second half would translate into very small downturn, but I wanted to be very -- this is a big detailed if we assume the spot rate to be at 1.14 we would have this very minute dip.
Let's move now to an overview of our balance sheet, the structure which has strengthened over the half year with total assets liabilities of €2.54 billion as against €2.40 billion last year. This was driven by an increase in inventory value and a better cash position.
Stock increased by €50 million to 1.17 billion at the end of September 2018 due to the increased capacity across our various categories, including in particular whiskey and rum and also as already mentioned, increased purchases of cognac will become more visible in the second half, starts account for 46% of total assets booked at their historical value, not in dollar market value.
The significant increase in cash currently stands at €162 million, mainly reflects the early repayment of the vendor loan by the EPI Group, whose value of the other hand is deconsolidated from noncurrent assets.
Our net gearing, our net debt to equity ratio improved over the period down from 32% to 21% pro forma value. Thanks to lower net debt and higher equity and lastly pro forma net debt totaled €303.9 million equating 26% of the accounting stock value.
Post IFRS 15, 16 and 9, group net debt totaled €331.7 million with the 30 or so million extra euros equating to the capitalized value of group leases under IFRS 16. Now let's review the key events in the first half of 2018, 2019.
On July 2, the group signed a €100 million syndicated loan funded by a pool of six bag with a five-year maturity at a much more attractive margin than what we have negotiated for previous syndicated loans. So this is much better.
ON July 10, the API decided to repay early the vendor loan that may be had granted it in July 2011. The vendor loan was originally taken out for a period of nine years and was supposed to be repaid in July 2020. Over the. period, annual interest rates charges of 5.6% depending on the year were due to be on 24 July at the AGM shareholders approved the payment of a dividend of 1.65 per share with an option allowing a full payment in shares.
As I mentioned earlier, we had a record number of shareholders opting to take payment in shares, 89% in total as opposed to 70% which was already huge last year and this generated a full year cash saving for the group of €16 million. And finally on August 1, 2018 the Group decided to implement share buyback program authorized by the Board of Directors for up to 1 million shares before April 30, 2019, the latest.
As you see, we started this program late and a bit slowly, but since then, we the group has brought back 377,000 shares for a total of around €39 million. Plus in the end now with two post closing event like I mentioned; one is something that were very proud of.
On 18 October, Remy Cointreau was awarded third place by rating and the finances ESG rating agency in the category of companies with sales of over €500 million, thus recognizing our global corporate responsibility strategy and we're very proud of this.
And on equities to come back to something more financial, Standard & Poor's upgraded group's rating from BB-plus to BBB minus. We are now rated Investment Grade by both S&P's and by Moody's. Moody's rates us BAA 3.
I will now give the floor back to Valérie Chapoulaud Floquet for look a look at the full-year outlook."
Valérie Chapoulaud Floquet,0,"Thank you, Luca. No big surprises in terms of full-year outlook in light of the great results of the first half. I’d recall we're very comfortable with our guidance in growth in current operating profit. We're giving our guidance, with confirmed growth in current operating profit as in the two previous years.
Thank you. I'd like to give the floor -- open the floor for questions now."
Q - Unidentified Analyst,1,"Yes hello. I have a couple brief questions. First of all China, you mentioned China continues to be very dynamic, could we find out about depletion rates right now and then in terms of H2 are you expecting early buying in Q3 for the Chinese New Year or do you think that will be more in Q4."
Valérie Chapoulaud Floquet,1,In terms of what?
Unidentified Analyst,1,Product launches or what have you?
Valérie Chapoulaud Floquet,1,"Now first of all in China, I believe many of other players in the industry have also confirmed that currently China continues to be very dynamic with long readings from outlook that's reassuring. Now will there be any [indiscernible] Nobody, we can't say so far is that when it comes to first half growth like 30%, that's a great beginning of the year, now depletion, the most recent figures, you're familiar with the double 11, a good barometer so to speak of the market activity.
We're in the neighborhood of 20% of sellout. What we see in the market, there is a panel in China, but at a minimum, that will be about order of magnitude or even to effect in China. So invoice plus 30 some activities double 11, performance last year already, standing at around 20% growth.
So all in all depending on circuit brand and region, we can say it's between plus 20 and plus 30% growth actual in China. So no slowdown especially since it's the third year running. Strong catch-up effect you remember in the first two previous years two good years ago plus last.
We're continuing at sustained pace. This in spite of some of the macroeconomic factors, we're all familiar with, that lead us to -- well, carefully we pay attention to the market. We're very much watching the market in China. Things can change overnight but anyway to do the macro factors are what they are, not necessarily all that positive considering what's going on between China and the U.S.
The stock exchange, the currency and so forth nevertheless. If you think of Chinese customers and the ones we are targeting, the figures have shown us that we can be very confident, that basically will consist of plus very good readout on festival.
As with any rule as such in China as in other market since the markets are more volatile. Nonetheless what we do know is when you got a good thought festival generally have a very good Chinese New Year the double 11 digital e-commerce, very highly sensitive to the market. So things are looking very good.
Very good festival. So we're expecting to have a very good Chinese New Year. Chinese New Year towards the beginning of February. We are not expecting any major impact in Q3 possibly a few million €2 million, €3 million €4 million, but no big effect in Q3.
But we're realizing is that our partners in all the different tiers have little bit shorter lead times. We're expecting more of a purchase impact, a buying impact beginning of January. We can tell the various wholesalers are paying careful attention to their cash and inventory levels. So maybe less repurchasing than previously, which is also what we're not there to be a surprise, but we're not expecting any main effects in Q3 due to the date of 8 February for the Chinese New Year.
Lastly on your second question, which is on communication spend, our second half pretty good pace as well in terms of advertising spending, your equivalent, we've put above the line includes the media mainly digital today, but not only mainly though, plus events, plus public relations.
The second half will also be sustained in terms of spend in this area. We have we have three main brands that are receiving these investments. Remy Martin of course not in usual advertising, but mainly guidance and public relations with our campaign, we call it campaign nonetheless because due to the lot involved, it's a 360 for LOUIS XIII plus the new ad campaign for Cointreau.
Investments continue to be quite sustained in the second half. We're highly confident that the first half has gone well. No reason to adjust downward investments. These are the three brands where we will be focusing our efforts. Now Remy Martin, this was the case last year, but even more focus this year.
Investments will be focusing on XO. This is why we have this visual reading again. So we use especially in events and certain establishments during meetings with customers, it's not an official picture as such. However investments in Remy Martin have prioritized XO, where not XO, we've got a mix with an immediate quality as we term this, mainly in the Western world such as a club in Asia.
It's important because in point of fact that they want to upscale it's very important for XO the spearhead of our communication or image. The next level qualities these are great uniquely positioned. No equivalent for the time being among the competitors. It's important for us to state our uniqueness in that area as well.
Another important point of recall in terms of success in the two intermediate qualities 738 and Club in Asia for instance, Club in some countries is going well above VSOP. In Asia, volumes are a lot more Club in VSOP, price positioning is much higher. So as you can see, our strategy is doing well.
It's successful in some areas in Asia we're now only beginning with the Club quality. Some Club XO and Louis of course. So these are the three houses that will feel of the bulk of our investment significantly so in the second half of Remy Martin, XO in the Western part of the world 738 and Eastern will be a club in addition. And no major launch in the second half of any new product."
Unidentified Analyst,1,"I wanted to supplement what you just heard in terms of vision and how that translates for the second half, contact first of all, we have this pro-form like unlike Vision which is 10.1%, we told you so. We managed the company with the organic growth as our main goal and we're working for an ultimate goal of 13.5%.
So what are the levers that we're going to have to work on to reach our goal, which is even higher than what we achieved over H1? The 10.1 we currently clocked in is totally in line with our forecast if not a little bit better because we have historical sharing out of the year between first and second half with more activity in the one than the other.
So what are we expecting that might lead to an increase in our profitability rate over the second half?"
Valérie Chapoulaud Floquet,1,"We're still extremely confident regarding sales, China in particular, but also for the rest of the world with some site exceptions for Europe at 7.7 is going to mean quite a lot in organic growth. Second point, we noticed that our gross margin is 90 basis points.
That certainly going to remain our main strategic lever to increase our profitability. Obviously we're investing, we're also investing in strategic distribution, we're doing some OpEx. We renewed partnerships with some operators. So some of the OpEx is highly strategic and that will lead to an increase in our results in order to meet our goals in terms of organic growth of plus 13.5%.
So we're going to increase our gross margin, increase our investment. I just wanted to share with you these elements that are these financial underpinnings of what was said."
Unidentified Analyst,1,"Hello [indiscernible]. Two questions, first on accounting front, what are your medium term goals in terms of gross margin? What with the rollout of IFRS 15, 16 and 9, otherwise you said that performance in Western Europe was a bit mixed. What exactly is the problem? Your brand positioning or the markets themselves?"
Valérie Chapoulaud Floquet,1,"Okay I'll deal with the market and then I'll give you the floor Luca. As regard to Western Europe, historically, our position is extremely strong on some markets, especially in Luxembourg where we're traditionally very strong, they are huge market shares, but as you know, Belgium adopted over two years ago, price and tax hikes, which led to a complete collapse of the spirit market.
Initially we thought that consumption will remain fairly stable, but in actual fact what we witnessed was a total disaster and for that matter, the same decisions taken in other countries led to the same awful result. So we think the market contracted by at least one third of its previous value and surprisingly and this is true also in other sectors that's been active in, what usually happens when you have that sort of situation, you see that there is a spillover in adjacent countries whereby you can possibly think that okay, Belgium is a small country, consumption is way down, but we're going to see consumption go up in Germany, the Netherlands, France, but now we were hoping to get 20%, 30% of our business back, but it didn't happen that way, because in actual fact, it's really consumption patterns have changed.
So we've had a considerable drop in market. We had the feeling that this was going to stabilize, but it's not even totally the case. So what are we trying to do? We're trying to keep our market share, the same share of the smaller pie, pie shrinking but we're trying to be as significant as the originator part of the pie and it's true that our brands are very good, but the situation is extraordinarily complex and it's a fact for everybody in the industry and not only have we not really talked in what results we hope would we hope, but we can't really see how this is going to happen.
France is really pretty stagnant. It's very hard to develop activities here. We're fairly stable, but we're suffering more of an impact on our mass-market activities Cointreau in particular, but you know we have two partners in France, no subsidiaries. Cointreau is now distributed by William Grant France, which used to be [indiscernible]. We used to have a joint venture we moved out of that.
Today mass-market players our focus on one thing to the decision of anything else our buying for less. So when you are going to see buyers and you tell them okay, everything else is happening we're going to increase our prices by a bit, they say okay, we'll see you next week because we're interested in lower prices period.
So we're doing alright in France but there is no growth for Cointreau, but in a market that's fairly negative even in value we're at least maintaining our share and we're growing by 25% for the other part of the market where we're partnering with even with good contacts with resellers etcetera.
So we're witnessing further growth -- further decrease in growth in Belgium. Germany is a bit of a problem. We changed partners in Italy recently. As you know when you do that, usually the first year is pretty terrible because you have to get to know each other. You have to position your brand on the different circuit, concentrate on the non-trade which is very high in Italy and it usually takes 12 to 24 months worldwide usually for that to become a smooth process.
So we think normally it takes that long term, We stabilize things, we've also partially changed our distributing arrangement in Spain and this is bit more business as usual because we're changing -- we renewed a contract and U.K. is doing really rather well simply because the market is very buoyant, outside even our brands.
So that when you look at what's happening in other markets and what our competitors are doing, nobody is jumping up with glee regarding Western European prospects. On the whole we're fairly well represented there and Eastern Europe has proved complicated during the first half of the year although the market is pretty buoyant, we had a few commercial issues with the first -- during the first half.
We were negotiating agreements in Russia and we had a very tough beginning of the year in the Ukraine where things are typically very yo-yo like. You get a very good quarter, then lousy quarter and back again. So we're very confident in terms of second half.
Western Europe shouldn't change much as opposed to Eastern Europe. We think the Middle East and India have started the year very well indeed. We change our strategy there little while ago and now we're finally reaping the benefits in terms of brands and Africa remains a very strong potential area with huge differences depending on the time, depending on the brand, depending on the market.
Over the last 18 months, we had fairly high oil prices in countries like Nigeria we're probably likely to have more foreign currency, but we didn't really see that translate into increased consumption. Europe is very diverse and you have to retain. Western Europe is high for everybody. U.K. is doing fine for the time being. We'll see what happens after Brexit, but it's a significant market because remember we bought back our activities there about four years ago and we're still on a rising trend. Luca?"
Luca Marotta,1,"Yeah I'll start with respect to financials. First of all we'll see what guidance we have to publish in June, but for the time being with a view to 2019, 2020, we are going to see the impact of what has been decided in the past. But 2019 scope we finished the year with profitability rate of 21% and guidance would be that will be up by 110 or 170 basis points and a five-year horizon.
Our landing point will be 22.1% to 22.7% in terms of profitability, which will mean an improvement of organic profitability in the 55 to 85 basis points range, but what's important is the change in accounting standards so that our sales are going to shrink, but we're going to have profitability up by 150 basis points.
This was something we did very well in the first half, but with this goal of 150 and the dollar at 1.19, we might hit the 24.2% we'll have to re-compute everything on the basis of exchange rates at the end of the period.
We think that post IFRS, we think that our organic profitability will be between 23.6 and 24.2 after therefore the rollout of IFRS 15, 16 and 9."
Marc Dubreuil,1,Do you have further questions?
Marc Dubreuil,1,Thank you very much. Have a great day.
