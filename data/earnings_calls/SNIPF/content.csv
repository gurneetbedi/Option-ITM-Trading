Operator,0,"Good day and welcome everyone to the Snipp Interactive First Quarter Fiscal 2018 Financial Results Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time, I’d like to turn the conference over to Mark Forney. Please go ahead sir."
Mark Forney,0,"Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone and welcome to Snipp Interactive’s first quarter fiscal 2018 conference call. This morning we issued our Q1 fiscal 2018 financial results. A copy of the press release is available on the Investor Relations section of our website and the financials are posted on SEDAR. We report our financials in U.S. dollars, so today’s discussion will use that currency unless otherwise noted.
Before beginning our formal remarks, I’d like to remind listeners that today’s discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect management’s current views with respect to future events. Any such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. Snipp does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements except as required.
I’ll now turn the call over to Snipp’s CEO, Atul Sabharwal. Please go ahead."
Atul Sabharwal,0,"Thanks, Mark, and thanks to all of you who've taken the time to attend our Q1 earnings call. I think we will eventually look back at Q1 2018 as of quarter in which our strategy just steadily grew existing accounts, while also working to aggressively develop new industry verticals really came together. In that regard, we are continuing to see smaller accounts morph into larger long-term SaaS type accounts within our traditional business lines. And our efforts to embed ourselves into the emerging cannabis marketing landscape have been met with exceptional interest.
This combination of evolutionary upgrades and potential new business makes us very optimistic about our future. For those of you who have track the Company for a while, you know that we spent close to six quarters transitioning our business from primarily a one-off promotions format where we’ve booked all of the revenue immediately to a model in with revenue spread out over many quarters.
In Q1 2018, we posted a 16% increase in revenue, reaching $2.87 million, compared to revenue for Q1 2017 of $2.48 million. So, we have clearly cross that demarcation point in which the longer term revenue streams have shifted from hurting our year-over-year comparisons to giving us a strong hedge start on every quarter, and that is pretty much the way we expect every quarter to be for the foreseeable future.
Our business can now be viewed in terms of increasingly deep and varied layers of revenue streams. This is a very important development for investors to remember because any incremental business can really add to what has become a much more predictable core revenue base for Snipp.
I’ll let Jason dig into the financials a bit more deeply in a moment and he will highlight how Q1 was another quarter of improvement across the board. We committed ourselves to lowering costs while also increasing sales and made progress on both of these fronts during the quarter. But first, I want to give investors a snapshot of where we think we are as a business.
Life in the world of our traditional consumer product clients is all about blocking and tackling. First, we have to get brands to try our services via few promotions with success, we hope each of these relationships will then expand into a longer term recurring revenue type of contract, based on our loyalty, rebate or licensing programs, each of which comes with a monthly recurring revenue stream.
The timeframe from first promotion to full loyalty customer can take 1.5 to 2 years for example and this after you might have to spend anywhere from six months to a few years to get certified as an official vendor. We will be shortly announcing such a certification with one of the world's largest, if not the largest food and drink multinational company that took us over three years to just get certified as a vendor.
We generally hope to sign one or two of these long-term accounts every single quarter. By now investors can begin to see the very positive effect of this revenue layering, and this is an open ended sticky model with great retention rates in many 100s of viable brands available as future customers. In that core traditional space 2018's business was usual but the timing of this base building in our traditional markets could not be better as it's relates to our efforts to penetrate new industry like the cannabis industry.
Because we already service essentially all of the other major regulator industries pharma, alcohol and tobacco in particular, but cannabis market is a natural extension of our expertise by planting the seeds what our software platforms can do for the cannabis industry today, we are positioning ourselves to monetize our efforts as further legalization occurs globally and we believe that this will be reflected in our 2019 financials as we begin deploying our solutions in a more mainstream fashion within this industry later this year.
Investors should understand how different the cannabis industry will be and what the opportunity could mean for Snipp. Some of our other regulated industries are more than a century your with tried-and-true marketing programs that date back generations. These Fortune 500 clients were massive, well established businesses before Snipp had designed the single product offering to bring them into the mobile and digital age.
The cannabis industry is similar to other regulated industries, familiar ground from an operational standpoint but completely different in terms of the maturity of the infrastructure and expertise of the cannabis participants. Many of the companies in this industry are younger than Snipp and the industry is so new that many firms we deal with are just beginning to organize their marketing departments.
Our expertise in the regulated space is proving to be a tremendous calling card. This is a remarkable time where Snipp is not just targeting customers but through our cannabis marketing research center, the CMRC for short actually has the potential to influence the role and style of marketing across the entire industry. We have never been this early in an industry formation phase, which gives us tremendous cachet in helping these new companies manage their marketing on the strict guidelines of demand compliance.
Later this afternoon, our cannabis marketing research center is hosting its first webinar title navigating the legal challenges of cannabis marketing and for those of you interested, I encourage you to sign up for a CMRC, if you would like to attend. We have tremendous interest in this resource. We are set for the industry and continue to attract new attention of companies large and small in the space for the capabilities we have to offer.
What does that mean going forward, I will let the numbers tell the story in a typical quarter we might have find a dozen fresh prospects and convert a few into new customers. Through the CMRC, we now over 60 companies that signed up, so combining these cannabis plays with our traditional consumer product group customers, we have more prospects plugged into our sales network than at any time in our company history.
We will try to predict a conversion rate just yet that is a very encouraging number, and we are confident the monetization within the cannabis space for all of us will begin by the end of this year. In addition, these customer relationships that we are receiving have the potential to be very different than the past because the industry has a flexible mindset for collaborations so early. For example, in the cannabis space, Snipp has the potential to sign partnerships that offer the Company an equity stake or options along with service revenue.
Structures that do not exist when dealing with Fortune 500 clients, we envision many different forms of collaboration in the space but whatever form our sales contract take, this is very fertile ground in its earlier stages. Our product suite represents now over 10 years of development, so by now we have by far the most robust offering of its kind in the industry, in that sense our business momentum can be measured in three categories
One, signing new CPG clients; two, transitioning existing CPG promotional clients into next level long-term recurring loyalty customers; and three, beginning our entrée into new markets, not only in cannabis, but also hospitality and market research which I've spoken very little about today. I am happy to report that thus far in 2018, we are finding considerable success in all three of these three areas of importance.
At this point, I would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Jaisun Garcha, who will provide some additional details on our Q1 2018 financials. Jaisun?"
Jaisun Garcha,0,"Thank you, Atul. As Atul mentioned, we generated a solid 16% revenue increase in Q1, bringing us in a $2.87 million and whether it's traditionally one of our slower quarters of the year. We posted improvement in many categories during the quarter. It should also be noted that the sales increase was achieved despite significant time and efforts spent on launching the cannabis sector initiatives.
In our quest toward profitability, Snipp showed great progress with a 54% improvement in EBITDA. In Q1 2018, our EBITDA loss of $0.47 million was less than half than Q1 2017 EBITDA loss of $1.01 million. Since the final earnout period of our last acquisition in Q1 2016, we have continued to implement integration and costs reduction programs to steadily reduce our fix costs.
This ongoing effort has resulted in over $2 million of costs savings accruing to the Company. In that regard, one of our largest areas of improvement in Q1 2018 was in salaries and compensation where we posted a 24% reduction year-over-year with a meaningful reduction of almost $587,000, more specifically, salaries and compensation dropped under the $2 million mark, coming in that $1.9 million in Q1 2018 versus $2.5 million in Q1 2017.
Although, the rest and smaller line items that we improved on as well, we hope that G&A and marketing expense will reduce by 13% and 26% respectively compared to the prior year. In terms of measuring our forward business, booking for Q1 2018 improved by 25% compared to Q1 2017, an increase of $0.76 million. Q1 2018 bookings were at $3.84 million versus Q1 2017 bookings of $3.08 million. A solid increase despite the time and effort dedicated to the new cannabis initiatives, which have not yet begun to contribute.
We are pleased to be able to grow our business in this fashion via existing prospects while we build out an important stream of potential customers in a new industry. Our total bookings backlog with our programs that have been sold, but these revenues has not yet been recognized, posted a 9% increased over Q1 2017 at $6.3 million at March 31, 2018 of which $5.5 million will be recognized over the remaining 2018 in fiscal 2019 periods.
Those metrics are important measure of our expanding monthly revenue base, which gives us a head start on every quarter and improves with each long-term contract. As a reminder, we previously defined bookings backlog as future revenue from the existing contracts to be recognized in the current fiscal year and following fiscal year.
The Company is now reporting bookings backlog as all future revenue including revenue that extend beyond the next fiscal year which in this case was beyond fiscal 2019. Bookings that translated into revenues based on IFRS principle, as the booking backlog reflects how revenues in future quarter are steadily being booked today.
Our revenue mix in Q1 2018 consistent of 61% promotions than rewards, 28% loyalty, 8% API and 3% rebase. This was pretty close to the mix during the same period in 2017 as Q1 tends to be promotions and rewards heavy. One area where we did not show an improvement was in our margins, which declined from 76% in Q1 2017 to 64% in Q1 2018. This was due to one of the main variables in our business, as we had some rewards based promotions that had higher reward redemptions than during the prior year.
That unusual condition also resulted in much higher campaign infrastructure costs or reward costs. Even with these aberrational campaign infrastructure costs, we were able to improve our net loss position by about 35% year-over-year. Overall, we are pleased with the progress we made in the quarter and believe that we can continue some of these positive trends throughout the remainder of fiscal 2018.
Now, I would like to turn the call over to Atul for some final thoughts."
Atul Sabharwal,0,"Thanks, Jaisun. As most of you saw in our earnings release my Co-Founder, Ritesh Bhavnani, is leaving our board of directors and management team for personal reasons, but he is not actually leaving our team in a complete sense. Ritesh will remain deeply involved as a consultant to enhance and develop Snipp's artificial intelligence and machine learning systems, but he will now be involved in a way that benefits his location given he has relocated to India and his time and perhaps Snipp constrained as a new father.
So this is more of a transition than anything else, it gives a more time during his regular hours to focus on core components and enhancements to our technology than trying to manage teams in time zones 10,000 miles away. The announcement also highlights our commitment to define and develop our industry-leading systems and promotion rewards and loyalty by utilizing advanced technology such as AI and machine learning to better serve our customers.
So where we at as a company, in 2018, we bolstered our financial position with about 3.5 million Canadian and financing, so we have an improved balance sheet to pursue our goals that also allowed for the full repayment of the Silicon Valley Bank credit facility, leaving us with no debt on the books as of today. We will shortly be announcing a new working capital facility with even fewer covenants that will allow us to continue to maintain a strong balance sheet without the need to carry out any financing at these levels in the near term. So watch out for that announcement in the coming days. 
One thing that investors should get used is our lineage to forge flexible and more creative partnerships and sales collaborations in the future. In addition to entering the hospitality space for example for the first time, we recently signed a five-year loyalty services agreement with the hospitality company based on a variable pricing model with the guaranteed flow. This marked the first for us in terms of both length and format. Clearly, this is a significant change because the model allows us to enjoy the upside associated with programs that grow their membership overtime was they just earning fixed fees.
We think that this could result in a consistent recurring revenue stream for the Company estimated to be anywhere between $0.5 million to $1 million under the single contract, with the guaranteed flow of $400,000. This is a kind of contract that can represent hidden upside. We intend to pursue additional contracts of this type when they are appropriate. As we highlighted at the start of this call, the cannabis space represents a rare and substantial opportunity gaining a strategic investment from Read MD was just the beginning, as you may recall from that press release this is was not just a passive investments.
Read MD like our other recently announced client Cannabis Life Sciences Corporation or CLS Holdings Inc. also appointed Snipp as its technology vendor or record could design and deploy custom marketing solutions for direct sales, retail sales, referrals, distributor and other programs that they have to implement. So, we are fully embedded in helping develop their marketing efforts. We envision a similar path along with some creative partnerships with other cannabis companies in the coming months.
Our CMRC platform is by far the fastest lead generator in our company history, so it's very easy to be optimistic about our future. We now have three-prong business pipeline with new customers and upgrade customers in traditional CPG and a potentially large business coming among greenfield customers in the cannabis hospitality and market research spaces. These trends make us very optimistic concerning our outlook and growth prospects through the end of 2018 and into 2019.
Okay, so we can open it up to questions, if any. I don’t see anybody lined up yet."
