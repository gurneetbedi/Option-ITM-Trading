Operator,0,"Good day, and welcome to the Pope Resources 2018 Investor Update Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I’d like to turn the conference over to Kirsten Chapman of LHA Investor Relations. Please go ahead."
Kirsten Chapman,0,"Thank you, David, and thank you all for joining us today for the Pope Resources June 2018 investor conference call. This is Kirsten Chapman of LHA Investor Relations. Please note today’s call is being webcast with an accompanying presentation. Both the webcast link and the presentation can be found at www.orm.com/investorrelations. Joining me today from management are, Tom Ringo, President and CEO; Mike Mackelwich, Vice President of Timberland Operations; Kevin Bates, Vice President of Timberland Investment; Jon Rose, Vice President of Real Estate; and Daemon Repp, Director of Finance.
It is now my pleasure to turn the call to Daemon Repp. Please go ahead sir."
Daemon Repp,0,"Thank you, Kirsten. We begin by reminding the audience that except for our statements about past performance, almost everything we say on this call, consists forward looking statements. To the extent we talk about our plans for the future, or our expectations for future business development, we ask that you recognize that these are not promises about our plans or guarantees of future performance.
There are many events and developments that could cause us to change our plans or to fall short of our expectations. The printed version of this presentation, which is available on our Web site, contains a brief summary of the known factors and our SEC reports contain more detailed discussion about these and other risks and uncertainties. And we ask that you read them as you are considering your investment decisions.
I will now hand it over to Tom Ringo."
Tom Ringo,0,"Thank you, Daemon. I’d turn your attention to Slide 4, but before I get there, I just want to make sure I welcome everyone and thank you for joining the call today. This is the second edition as Kirsten said of what we intend to be a series of annual teleconferences, where our primary objective is to give investors, whether current unit holders or those interested in the Company for any number of reasons, give those folks an opportunity to hear management discuss directly the opportunities and challenges that face the Company as we execute on our growth strategy.
To give this hour long call a broad outline, our plan is to give you 35 to 40 minutes of prepared remarks where you will hear the voices of five members of the management team. We will pass the speaking baton to each other as we spin through the slide deck accompanying this teleconference. And Kirsten has already introduced the team by name and title. After prepared remarks, the balance of the call will be devoted to Q&A. And when we get there, we’ll all get instructions on how questions may be teed up for management response.
So Slide 4, Pope Resources’ overview. This slide is an overview of the Company with a call-out of selected key attributes. All of these attributes will get more discussion as our managers unpack, in turn, each of the business segments. Pope Resources, as most of you know, is a Master Limited Partnership or MLP, a last timber company organized in this fashion where once there were a handful. In a few slides, I’ll comment on what we consider to be the key tax advantage of this form of governance has for individual investors.
Through predecessor company, Pope & Talbot, we have roots that go back over more than 1.5 centuries here in Pacific Northwest. The Partnership owns outrights nearly 120,000 acres of prime Pacific Northwest timberland and 2,100 acres of development property, all in the State of Washington, and when it comes to the development property all in the lead of Seattle, nation’s hottest real estate market. Nested inside this MLP, there is also this private equity business centered on Timberland with three timber funds holding 124,000 acres in the states of Washington, Oregon and California. And draw your attention to the map on Slide 4 for a rough idea where the plantations are located. Finally, our units trade on NASDAQ under the symbol POPE, and currently offer yield of just about 4%.
Let’s go to Slide 5. We have recently migrated, talking about our Company in terms of four business segments, as opposed to the three that we have historically referenced. We’ve gone from three to four by splitting the key timber segment into its partnership and Fund component parts. As the significance in size of our Fund business has grown, it has become ever more apparent that we needed to do more to help POPE unit holders clearly understand our performance results as it pertains to cash flows supportive of distributions.
Looking left to right on the Slide 5 offers a synopsis of each segment, together with recent performance metrics, expressed in terms of adjusted EBITDA. The definition of this metric starts with the familiar acronym EBITDA and eliminates gains on timberland sales and adds back environmental remediation expenses embedded in the real estate results. The chart at the bottom of this Slide 5 will reappear later in the deck and Daemon will speak to notable patterns over the years, spanning 2009 to early 2018.
Moving to Slide 6. Unit holder distributions are essential aspect of how we deliver value to investors in POPE. This chart indexes our historical distributions to a December 2007 starting point pre-global financial crisis. And using the same indexing overlay compares our payouts to those of our timber REIT peers. As you study this chart, you notice some interesting patterns. The green line is for POPE, and you can see how we responded to the GFC by dramatically dropping our distribution. Then starting in 2010, we have since stair-stepped the distribution backup smartly to its current annual rate of $2.80 a unit, or that 4% yield I previously mentioned.
We’ve been holding our distribution flat for almost three years as we work our way out of the peak environmental cleanup spend at Port Gamble. Since the worst of that cleanup is now behind us, we look forward to resuming a growth pattern to the distribution. And let's not forget that our distribution is a tax-free return of capital.
Let’s go to Slide 7. Now whether it’s looking at after-tax yields prior to recent tax reform or after, we believe that the most tax-advantaged way for an individual to own timber is an MLP, even better than a REIT. Of course, individual circumstances vary so exceptions to such blanket statements are conceivable. Our Annual K-1 bifurcates the Partnership‘s income into two primary categories or buckets, if you will, ordinary loss and capital gain. In a typical year, the net of these two amounts is a positive income number. But because the ordinary loss is to offset income tax at an individual, say top marginal rate of 37%, while we capital gains tax at 20%, the interplay of these different rates produces a tax benefit in many cases. Now, those benefit has been somewhat muted in recent years as environmental spend at Port Gamble has disturbed at typical pattern. But the broad pattern is set to resume now that the worst for the cleanup his is largely behind us.
So I'd like to invite you now to turn to Slide 8, and I'll hand the speaking role over to Mike Mackelwich."
Mike Mackelwich,0,"Thanks, Tom. Pope Resources’ strategy for its timber portfolio is to create long-term value from the harvest and management of a specific northwest timberlands and related resources and secondly, through the targeted acquisition of additional timberlands. We have the sustainable harvest schedule that is based on net available acres, and we implement civil culture practices that reduce future harvest cost and produce a desirable sort mix, ultimately providing optimal returns to unit holders. We grow our opportunity for cash available for distribution with a thoughtful and disciplined approach to acquisitions of small track timber lands. And through the co-investment in private equity, timber Fund vehicles where Pope Resources currently has an equity stake ranging from 5% to 20%.
Turning to Slide 9. Looking at the table, in our Fee Timber portfolio, Pope owns at 119,000 acres of timberland in Washington State, together with some long-term timber bids, the net acres of which provide the basis for the 52 million board foot annual cut. Through the Partnership’s equity stake in the Funds, Pope has exposure to log markets in Central and Southern Oregon, and Northern California, which creates added log market debt that would not exist without the Funds.
In row two of that table, average side index is identified side index as a common major of growing productivity, the average Douglas-fir site index with the Partnership lands is a 113 feet at base age 50. This dropped slightly to 112 feet when blending in Pope’s portion of Fund acres. Site 112 to 113 is what foresters term high site three timberland that is good quality. Turning now to the chart at the lower left of the page, you can see the age class distribution of the Partnership’s timberlands, shown a reasonably well distributed age class profile with the heaviest concentration in the 25 to 34-year-old tranche.
Looking at the pie chart on the lower right, you will see that we primarily grow Douglas-fir. Douglas-fir is a species that commends a premium, and is sought by end users because of its superior strength. It also has lower term dry times than other species, and has some un-dried green product options. Then of course it has a beautiful appearance and is used for open being construction at times to display that trade.
Turning to Slide 10. In the Pacific Northwest, especially where most of our timberlands are located, log prices are supported by diverse log markets with access to both domestic mills in Asia. Our primary market is the domestic log market where products are used mostly for home construction, so framing lumber, beam supply wood OSB, cabinets and doors. Export demand provides market diversification for us that that keeps pressure on the domestic markets. We sold logs to export brokers who market those logs to China, Japan and Korea for use in many products, including concrete forms, appearance lumber and pallet stock.
Looking at the chart, you see our export percent shown as light brown bars keen off the left hand Y axis. When domestic takeaway is weak due to poor U.S. housing starts, Asian markets are important to Pope Resources. Notice that since 2010, there has been a narrowing in the premium between export log prices, shown as the blue line and domestic log prices, shown as the green line; both keen off the right hand Y axis and both in nominal terms. The continuance of that narrow premium through 2018 indicates sustained competition between U.S. mills and Asia for our logs. Much of this is related to China's significant appetite for logs to feed their construction sector.
Our current log prices -- strong log prices in quarter one 2018 are attributable to strong takeaway for domestic housing, duties on Canadian lumber and pressure from Asia as previously described. And as implied by the chart, the U.S. domestic market has always been our primary outlet for logs. And we believe this will remain true, moving forward, as U.S. housing starts and repair and remodel activities increase in the U.S. in coming years.
Turning to Slide 11. You heard us log some from timberland assets of Pope and the Funds in Washington, Oregon and Northern California. As indicated earlier, the Partnership’s sustained harvest level is 52 million board feet. It’s shown as the black line below in the chart. The increase in the cut from 2014 to ’15 resulted from improved inventory information and better optimization software used in our long-term planning process, which we generally update every five years and which we did update at the end of 2014.
The increase from 2015 to ’16 of 4 million feet is related to the addition of the 7,300 acre Carbon River tree farm purchased by Pope Resources in 2016. And we also opportunistically harvest additional volume from our real estate portfolio when markets are strong, and that's not part of that 52 million board feet sustained cut. Added volume is also taken strategically from small tract acres.
We did increase our harvest target in 2018 above the 52 million board foot mark as blue bars indicate, or as the blue bar for at least 2018 indicates, as forecast for ’18. And that’s due to excellent log prices that developed in 2017 and early 2018. The extra 14 million board feet there in 2018 will not impact that 52 million board feet sustained harvest level, because it comes from real estate acres and small tract acres not yet included in our long-term sustained cut calculation. Pope Resources also realizes revenue from volume harvested from Fund Timberlands, that's depicted in green in the chart, and that share of the Funds is projected to be 9 million board feet for 2018.
Turning to Slide 12. We started acquiring what we have termed small tract timberlands programmatically in 2014. These acquisitions are strategic and that they increase our land base and our sustained harvest yield partly through improving our age class profile and that is one of the programs' expressed purposes. In 2014 through ’17, we added almost 5900 gross acres for a total of $20.5 million, much of which has been 1031 Exchange proceeds from real estate and conservation sales as we reposition assets and move them away from North Kitsap County, Washington to more timber friendly areas. 2018 has been active on the small tract front with four acquisitions in quarter one, totaling just under 900 acres for $5.4 million. The cash on cash return for those four acquisitions from quarter one in '18 will be roughly 85%, because there is a significant amount of timber on these tracts.
That concludes the Fee Timber prepared remarks, and I’ll pass up the tone to Kevin Bates for a discussion of Timberland Investment Management segment."
Kevin Bates,0,"Thank you, Mike and good morning everyone. I have the pleasure, as Mike said, speaking with you today about our private equity timberland business. The purpose of this business segment is to leverage our Pacific Northwest timberland management expertise to sponsor and co-invest in timberland investments vehicles, focused exclusively in the Pacific Northwest. This business segment has represented our primary growth vehicle over last 12 years, and today it represents timberland with a total value of $490 million.
Please turn to Slide 14. The table on the top of this Slide provides a snapshot of where our private equity strategy sits today. I will highlight a few numbers from this table, starting with the top row, to help explain how the table is constructed. The three funds we are currently managing own a total of 124,000 acres, which you can see they are in the center column. The Partnership owns 20% of Fund II, 5% of Fund III and 15% of Fund IV. If you apply these percentages to acres owned by each of the funds, the Partnership’s equity interest in the funds represents 15,000 acres across the states of Washington, Oregon and California.
The diversification the Partnership enjoys in its timberland portfolio would not be possible if the partnership were only investing its own capital. To illustrate this point, I would like to draw your attention to the cumulative paid-in capital figure of $43 million, which represents paid-in capital for Funds II, III, and IV. If the Partnership were investing only its own capital, that $43 million would be invested in one or maybe two tree farms bought in one or two separate transactions. By investing in these private equity timber vehicles, that same paid-in capital instead represents an interest in nine separate timberland properties acquired in nine separate transactions between 2009 and 2018.
Moving a few rows below cumulative paid-in capital, you will find current Fund debt. We have used timberland mortgages in Funds II and III, totaling $57 million. Fund debt is collateralized only by Timberland in each of these respective funds. There is no cross collateralization with Partnership properties. The Partnership’s share of that fund debt, using it for proportional equity interest in these funds, is $7 million.
The next row I would like to draw your attention to is carried interest. Carried interest is earned when investors have received their entire paid-in capital plus their preferred return in cash distributions. The $10 million indicated in the table is a pro forma amount based upon the latest third party of appraisal reports, and assuming the properties are sold at their appraised value. Note that carried interest represent, the cost of the third-party investors and income to the Partnership, or more precisely to its wholly owned subsidiary, Olympic Resource Management. Just to be clear, our investors in these vehicles own common shares are limited liability company units. And as such, there is no guarantee that investors will receive that preferred return.
Finally, internal rate of return as a blended figure for all of our private equity investment vehicles. We acquired the properties in our first fund in late 2006, not long before the global financial crises. We liquidated that fund prior to the end of its fund life generating a 3.3% internal rate of return. The funds we are currently operating follow a somewhat predictable pattern with those investment vehicles with the lease operating history at lower returns, while those vehicles that we have managed for a longer period of time are higher. This is due to the cost incurred in the first few years placing capital, which dragged down returns until the investments have been managed for a longer enough period of time to fund those early costs.
For example; Fund II, which was placed in 2009 and 2010, currently has a 12% internal rate of return; Fund III, placed from 2012 to 2015, is currently at 5.3% internal rate of return; Fund IV is negative as we’re still working on placing capital and have had less than a quarter to manage the newly acquired properties in this fund. The Fund II portfolio also has benefitted from being placed certainly after the global financial crisis when timberland values were at a cyclical level. The higher return for the Partnership’s share of the Funds is due to the pro forma carried interest on Fund II, which is expected to be paid to Olympic Resource Management ones the Fund is liquidated.
Now please turn to Slide 15. The purpose of this slide is to give an indication of current and historic cash flow generated from our private equity business as the proportion of the Partnership’s distributions. We are currently generating $3 million of asset management fee annually. When you add cash distributions paid to the Partnership due to its co-investment in these funds, we are currently generating cash in this operation of more than 35% of the Partnership’s cash distributions. We expect that we’ll continue to increase as we place capital for Fund IV. The spike you see in 2013 is due to a mortgage that was taken out on our Fund II portfolio with proceeds distributed back to investors.
I am now turning to Slide 16. We were very pleased to close on our first two Fund IV acquisitions in early 2018. We are cautiously optimistic that over the remainder of 2018 we will buy one or two additional properties to add to this portfolio. We currently have committed capital in this fund of $273 million to place, of which $41 million represents Partnership co-investment. Fund IV is constructed a little differently than our prior funds, and that the term is longer at 15-years versus 10-years from our previous fund. The draw down period can be expanded to five years, and there are only four investors plus Pope Resources. All of our partners in this vehicle are knowledgable long-term timberland investors.
That concludes my prepared remark. And I will turn it over to Jon Rose to cover our Real Estate segment."
Jon Rose,0,"Thank you, Kevin. Please turn to Slide 17. In Real Estate, our Group creates and harvest higher and better use real-estate value through a variety of entitlement and development strategies that benefit from our proximity to Seattle and Tacoma. Today, we’ll provide a market overview and review some of our key strategies and projects.
Please turn to Slide 18. Seattle and Puget Sound are experiencing a perfect storm of real estate supply and demand. The Seattle area remains the highest real estate market in the nation with over 50 construction cranes in use. This historic demand falls from the aggressive hiring of Amazon and other technology companies. This period of high demand is also taking place during a period of record scarcity of land upon which to build new homes and other developments.
This scarcity is derived from a law Washington State passed in 1991. That was the Growth Management Act that mandates that cities and counties must concentrate growth in compact urban areas. These urban growth areas are filling to capacity, leaving builders and developers scrambling to find project sites all over Puget Sound. Years ago, the Company worked to position its holdings inside urban growth areas. We have been and we will continue to enjoy the fruits of this effort for years to come. Being able to execute long-term asset repositioning like this is an advantage we enjoy over other real estate development organizations that don't have the luxury of time in positioning and capitalizing their projects.
Our holdings in Kitsap County received a significant boost in value, when Kitsap County passed the bond measure to initiate high-speed passenger-only ferry service to downtown Seattle in three locations. These boats will deliver commuters to downtown Seattle in less than 35 minutes. Please turn to the map to see the location of these boats. The Bremerton service began in 2017. It is very popular and the boats are regularly full to capacity.
The Kingston boat is slated to begin in operations in 2018, but might be delayed till 2019. And the Southworth boat is scheduled to begin in 2020. Its instructors study Bainbridge Island, which has enjoyed a 35 minute ferry ride to Seattle for decades. Bainbridge Island is now one of the most expensive communities in Puget Sound. The effect of these market dynamics and improved transportation systems is the westward migration of homebuyers and homebuilders, seeking affordable land that is now within commuting distance to Seattle.
I’d like to draw your attention to the area of the map around Kingston and Port Gamble. In 2007, the Company owed 8,000 acres in this area where over 85,000 people lived. We deem this to be too populated and risky with regards to long-term industrial timberland management, and decided to reduce our exposure there. We began a partnership with the communities to help it raise money and purchase many of these lands. This effort concluded in December of 2017, and the community now owns approximately 4,500 acres in a mild waterfront.
Known as the Kitsap Forest and Bay project, the proceeds from these transactions help to fuel our small tract acquisitions and timber fund co-investments, which purchase land in more remote timber friendly locations. Further, by selling to a county government for park and recreation uses rather than a timber or development company, we have reduced supply of residential properties and created a major amenity for all of our 3,500 acres of retained lands. These lands will benefit from a rising tide of residential real estate values.
Now please turn to Slide 19 for an overview of some of our key projects that are enjoying our urban growth and asset repositioning strategy. Harbor Hill is a 330 acre property and this former timberland that was placed inside the City of Gig Harbor urban growth area in 1998. Active development began in 2006. We expect to wind up the development this year with the sale of our last 65 single family lots and an 18 acre retail commercial property. Harbor Hill has been a very successful project. Its completion and 12 years of development has set us well for our Arborwood and Port Gamble projects.
The Arborwood project was placed in the Kingston urban growth area in 2011. We now have approval to develop 750 residential units in a project that is only two miles from the Kingston ferry. Arborwood will benefit from a new 800 acre park that was created from Kitsap Forest and Bay project, and is directly adjacent to the project. We are already receiving strong interest from regional and national homebuilders. We believe the small lots, close proximity to the ferry and good schools will be highly attractive to Seattle commuters. And we anticipate starting our first phase of development in 2019 or 2020.
Port Gamble is our historic company town that lies eight miles from the Kingston ferry terminal. We have been positioning this property for eventual development and disposition for many years, starting with the rezone of the township urban style zoning in 2000. We now have zoning for over 290 residences and 100,000 square feet of commercial. We have been conducting environmental cleanup activities in Port Gamble since 2002.
Last year, we completed the most significant portion of the environmental cleanup with the dredging of 100,000 cubic yards of sediment from Port Gamble Bay and removal of 800,000 creosoted piles. There's still cleanup to be done on the mill side itself, but we expect this to be far less costly than the dredging project. That work should take place in 2019 and 2020.
You may have noticed last week we received some disappointing news from Washington State Supreme Court, which denied our petition to find that the Washington State Department of Natural Resources is liable to contribute to our past and future cleanup costs. This decision does not create any new environmental liabilities it just eliminates the Department Of Natural Resources as a potential contributor.
Our positioning of Port Gamble has provided with adequate urban services. In the last years, we completed construction of a brand new waste-water treatment plant in connection to a local water utility. Now Port Gamble has enough sewer and water capacity for its full development. The aforementioned Kitsap Forest and Bay project will benefit Port Gamble with over 3,000 acres of new public-park and trials, and a mile of public water front directly adjacent to the town. We are revising and resubmitting our master plan to Kitsap County this summer, and hope to have projects approval in two to three years.
We believe Port Gamble with its historic character water front location, access to Seattle and acres of parkland will be highly attractive to its high rise Kitsap County. These buyers have now built significant equity in their homes, and will be able to relocate and take advantage of Kitsap County's relatively lower housing cost and laid-back lifestyle.
Regarding conservation sales, the Company began to actively court the sale of conservation fee and easement sales around the year 1998. Conservation easements extinguish development rights but they allow for continued management of the timberlands. We sold over 17,000 acres of conservation easements and over 12,000 acres in fee for over $51 million in revenue since 1998, and we are working all the time to keep the pipeline full with new projects. We expect the closing of at least one significant conservation easement sale this year.
Now please turn to Slide 20. That focus is on Bainbridge landing. We've included a special focus on this project as its Company's first private equity play in real-estate. As in our Timberland Management business, the Company believes it can improve benefits from the opportunistic execution of private equity joint venture projects that create reoccurring cash flows and leverage outside equity and debt. We are 50-50 joint partners with another local firm, and have provided about 12% of the required equity. Details on the capitalization are included on the slide. The project is under construction and will produce 107 apartment units and 25% of homes. Bainbridge landing lies only 900 feet from the existing Bainbridge Seattle ferry landing is going to significantly benefit from the intense housing pressure we’re all experiencing.
And now, I'd like to turn it back over to Daemon Repp."
Daemon Repp,0,"Thank you, Jon. I'm on Slide 21 where we illustrate adjusted EBITDA by segment. Our efforts across the Company that you have just heard describe combining the strong markets in each of our four segments have resulted in increased cash generation since the global financial crisis. Through improving log prices, increased harvest volume, growth of our Timber Fund business and capitalizing on our real-estate development projects. These factors resulted in $37.2 million of consolidated adjusted EBITDA during 2017, and a solid start to 2018 with $11.7 million in het first quarter.
Turning to Slide 22. We present the various perspectives from which one can measure our financial performance. This is important because our GAAP financial statements include the results of non-controlling interest, which is a significant amount. Non-controlling interest represents a portion of our Timber Funds owned by the Funds’ third-party investors. One such perspective is Partnership, which includes the ownership and operation of our Hood Canal and Columbia tree farms totaling 119 acres, the investment management of our three timber funds and the ownership and operation of our 2,100 acre real-estate portfolio.
Secondly, the consolidated perspectives represents our GAAP results, and includes the ownership and operation of everything owned by the partnership in our three timber funds. The consolidated perspective results in the elimination of fee revenue earned by our Timberland Investment Management segment with the corresponding elimination of the fee expense incurred in the Fee Timber Funds segment.
Finally, the look through perspective represents the Partnership, plus its 20% interest in Fund II, 5% interest in Fund III and 15% interest in Fund I. Per gap we have always recorded our look through net income on our consolidated income statement, and the fees paid by our third party investors have always been part of that looks through net income amount. With the release of our first quarter 2018 results, we began disclosing other financial metrics on a look through basis as we felt it provided current and perspective unit holders with the better sense of the financial results of owning a Pope unit. Further detail on these definitions and our financial results are presented in Appendix A of this presentation.
Turning to Slide 23. We present recent key financial information from the three perspectives I just discussed. Our solid first quarter 2018 results reflect the continuation of the strong trends we experienced during 2017. I would like to highlight first quarter 2018 net income as it is the same for all three perspectives, which may lead to some questions or confusion. For the partnership net income was $5.7 million, the combined net income of our three timber funds totaled zero and that’s our consolidated net income was also $5.7 million. Finally, the partnership's share of each of the three timber funds net income coincidentally also totaled zero and that’s our look through or GAAP net income was also $5.7 million. This is a coincidence that we would not expect to repeatedly off in future reporting periods.
On Slide 24, we endeavor to break down one of the side effects of our consolidated GAAP financial statements. Our consolidated balance sheet reflects all of the debt held by the partnership and the funds totaling over $145 million. While it is important to note that the partnerships look through debt is only $95 million, it is even more important to understand that there is no cross collateralization between the funds, debt and the partnerships assets. The partnerships debt agreements with this vendor are completely separate from those of the funds with the debt held by the partnership collateralized by a portion of the partnerships timberland and real estate portfolio and the debt held by each of Fund II and Fund III collateralized by portions of their respective timberland portfolios. Again, there is no cross collateralization between the partnership Fund II or Fund III.
I’ll now turn it back to Tom."
Tom Ringo,0,"Thank you, Daemon. And so ringing at home first on Slide 25, as is apparent from the preceding comments by my colleagues, there’s a lot going on with the Company and the balance of 2018 looks very promising to management for three primary reasons. One, strong log prices have us teed up for a record harvest volume here when partnership and funds are combined. Two, sourcing opportunities to deploy fund for committed capital is front and center for us and it's not just about responding to options. Three, the real estate sales to finish off our Harbor Hill project in Gig Harbor, as well as other smaller land transactions plus conservation easement sales awaits us. It's a fare play to realize all this and bring it home.
Slide 26 in terms of takeaways, we’re the beneficiaries of geography and like, they say the real estate location, location, location its truly applicable when you think about our real estate portfolio and that location, next to Seattle, but it is also true for timberland. And being located here on the Eastern shore of the Pacific Rim is a very great place to be, we love where we’re located. And I think in last year's call I talked about the 21st century being the Pacific century if you could think of the 20th as the European century. We love being on this side, left coast of the U.S. facing towards Asia, and I think it provides an awful lot of opportunities for us going forward. We paid an attractive after-tax yield with partnership vehicle that management wants to grow. Lastly hopefully this call gives credibility to my assertion that there is a highly capable management team in place at Pope Resources, all of whom are working very hard each day to create long-term value for our unit holders and investors.
Thanks for your time and attention and we will now shift in the Q&A mode."
Operator,1,[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Collin Mings with Raymond James.
Collin Mings,1,"First question for me is just maybe, can you talk a little bit more about the plans as far as the deployment of the 270 million as it relates to Fund IV. Just where are you seeing in terms of acquisition opportunities? Have you seen any movement in terms of discount rates or generally as that pricing up there, so just if you can explain on that that would be great to start?"
Kevin Bates,1,"Absolutely, thank you Collin. This is Kevin. And the transaction market during the specific northwest has started 2018 a little bit slow. 2017 I’d say also was a little bit slow, but we were successful in placing a couple transactions. So we hope for the same in 2018. We will continue to reach out to individual landowners here and try to raise some transaction activity that isn’t currently publicly known about. And hope to have some success on that. We are pleased to say that we do have couple of things we are looking at now. In terms of discount rates what I’d say on that is that we are seeing some increase in discount rates, but that is offset by these increased loss prices that we have enjoyed recently here.
So it's hard. When I think about the transaction market we are enjoying today I compare it to prior to the GSP then I’d agree that prior to global financial crisis, we were seeing a lot of transactions going at values that were difficult for us to support, for us to make sense. And I’d say what we are seeing today is generally speaking is that there is a little more discipline in the market, which of course is very helpful for us as we are trying to place capital. So that’s where we are and we are cautiously optimistic, we will get some additional capital."
Collin Mings,1,"On that front I mean just as far as some of the opportunities you are looking at I mean made reference obviously some of the smaller tracts that you guys have identified, but are you feeling, I mean I guess, in terms of deal size, is there kind of a sweet spot as you think about deployment of capital that you hope to uncover some opportunities then?"
Kevin Bates,1,"We expand the board on that. We look at larger transactions as well as smaller transactions. And on that point, the work we have been doing on smaller transactions for the partnership, we are translation that expertise we have developed to do the same thing on the private equity side. So we have been looking at smaller opportunities in Oregon as well for the fund the business and we are appropriate. So we will expand the market from that perspective and have opportunities to look at capital outside of the fund structure just to the extent we end up with something larger that really wouldn't be appropriate to put entirely into the fund. So while we concentrate generally in the middle market, we expand it all and look at larger transactions and smaller transactions."
Collin Mings,1,"Okay and then maybe switching gears just kind of from a bigger picture standpoint. Can you guys talk about again, you highlight the strength of your markets and clearly log pricing in the Pacific Northwest has been healthy versus 2018, but just as you think about potential trade wars, potential shifts in terms of the export market, maybe just offer your thoughts on to the extent that you think the Company or more broadly the sector could be impacted by a potential trade war?"
Mike Mackelwich,1,"So this is Mike Mackelwich responding, and the export market for us is an important diversifier. It’s roughly in round terms 20% of our opportunity. In China specifically is just a portion of that. There's been a lot of press regarding tariffs we realized that none have been enacted, and there're many products from the U.S. that could be the target of tariffs and we don't necessarily think U.S. log exports are high on the list. It's really tough to predict the exact impact because as you're aware the situation is certainly very fluid."
Kevin Bates,1,"I'd like to add to that. The China market I would say is probably the largest risk factor in our log market, but there isn't reason to be concerned at this point about a trade war affecting our export logs."
Collin Mings,1,"Got you, I think maybe what you tried to say that any potential impact would be more of a second tier consequence in other words maybe the impact -- there was something to explode obviously the U.S. economy or the Asian economy penetrate trade war than obviously there might be some past that are impact on you guys, but as far as kind of the direct impact is related to tariffs on actual log shipments or even on the lumber side of the equation out of the Pacific Northwest does seem like remote chance at this point, but is that fair?"
Kevin Bates,1,"That's fair. The domestic mills are driving our market. Domestic housing starts are driving our market and our main market, and so I think that's fair."
Collin Mings,1,"Got you, okay. And then again you've clearly highlighted, it's on Slide 10, you guys have kind of the pricing as far as the log pricing out in the Pacific Northwest, but maybe just catch a little bit more on, how you in fact could move around a little bit as it relates to lumber pricing? Because clearly we've seen a lot of strength in lumber pricing, go up meaningfully year-over-year. What are you watching for, is there anything that concerns you, what maybe we see a pullback in lumber pricing that could then lead to a pullback in log pricing? Or do you think the supply demand dynamics are such where even if lumber pricing pull back a little bit that you think the log pricing would remain resilient? Just as you think about that interplay between the two, just update us on your thoughts there?"
Kevin Bates,1,"I’ll give Mike a break for a second, here while I comment on that because I should have commented on this in the Timberland transaction piece. One of the interesting dynamics in our log market here in the Pacific Northwest is the export market does not correlate well with the lumber market and so that causes a level of stress at the manufacturing level where you can have log prices increasing to the export market where lumber markets are pretty muted, and it makes it difficult to operate the mills. One of the things we’ve seen over the last few years in the transaction market that reflects this is more participation by integrated forest products companies to own mills, going in and buying timberland to try to provide some shelter for themselves from this export market exposure, which is making it more challenging for them to operate."
Mike Mackelwich,1,"And just expanding on Kevin's comments, this is Mike. You’ve referenced that lumber prices are up, that prices recently for logs has slid, and there are a lot of logs out in the marketplace. We do think that there's room for those to tick up again later in the year particularly if we start to see fire weather intensifies so there are a lot of factors that are going on in the marketplace that contribute to the log pricing."
Collin Mings,1,"We’re in that season when logs can flow most freely from the woods towards the mills, and that runs for another four months, five months or so, and that you’re suggesting Mike that we’ll see perhaps later in the year some reduction of flow, that will support prices on a log end?"
Mike Mackelwich,1,"Yes, likely. And at the risk of stating the obvious, here in the Pacific Northwest, we’ve had good log takeaway for quite a while, since the global financial prices and as a result we do not have the deferred volume on the stump that you’ll see in other regions of the U.S. So there’s much more tension in our markets, a decrease in lumber prices would not necessarily cause a decrease in log prices if the demand for the logs were still there. We do not again have a bunch of volumes sitting on the stump waiting to be harvested."
Collin Mings,1,"So the bottom line it sounds like you guys still expect a reasonably healthy price environment, maybe a little bit of a pull back on lot of pricing seasonally, but overall healthy pricing environment, would not really infer direct fluctuations, tighter lumber, is that fair?"
Mike Mackelwich,1,That’s fair and also we would also say that that seasonality could well cause an increase in log prices later in the summer as things get dry and harvest activities have to be curtailed on certain tree farms.
Operator,1,"[Operator Instructions] Next, we’ll go to Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson."
Kurt Yinger,1,"Just looking at the harvest for this year, what sort of dictates how long you would plan to sort of be above the sustainable level going forward?"
Mike Mackelwich,1,"This is Mike Mackelwich answering that question. Generally, our sustainable harvest level is what we will cut every year, and we opportunistically take advantage of market conditions that allow us to cut more, but there’re some limits to that in and its limited to mostly our real estate portfolio and small tract acquisitions that haven’t yet been rolled into that long-term planning process."
Kurt Yinger,1,"And then you just touched on this a bit, but I was wondering if you could talk about sort of the help of the domestic Pacific Northwest sawmills. It seems like the differential in margins with the South seems to be just only getting wider, and I'm wondering how your customers are thinking about that? And how that potentially impacts capital expansion and future demand?"
Kevin Bates,1,"Our lumber mills here in the Pacific Northwest are making money in current markets, and again, the acquisition of Timberland is kind of a defensive measure for times when the domestic market is weak while the export market is strong. And we just had as some of you are aware a large privately held companies gears up to begin this for you just rebuilt a mill near up in Shelton, and I’d say that would be an indication or competence in the market moving forward. I think our mills are doing fine and healthy. Mike, do you have anything that you would add to that?"
Mike Mackelwich,1,I think you have covered it.
Tom Ringo,1,"Kurt, this is Tom Ringo, and I want to come back for a moment on the sustainable harvest comments Mike made. That is an important part of this target level for us. And we will modulate up and down from the some, certainly you saw us modulate significantly during the GFC downward to take advantage of better markets that we thought would come. And the constraints with one other things that we are mindful of in terms of modulation around that center point for that sustainable harvest is contractor availability, and I know a lot of the other publics that three REIT peers, you hear about that and its certainly showing our area that contractor availability isn’t a challenge. So, steady work flow is certainly an advantage in retaining value contractors. So, too much modulation while it sounds great in terms of taking best optimal advantage of markets, I think they are either up or down, the contractors situation provides some level of governor on how much modulation one is incline to sub branch of that puzzle."
Mike Mackelwich,1,"And I’ll add a little bit to that as well. In our private equity business, we are much quicker to adjust volumes up and down based upon what's going on with log markets. So, we compound several buckets of timber volume with which to adjust or modulate based upon what's going on with markets. And when we think about log prices we have a lot of historical data as a result of participating here in these log markets in the Pacific Northwest selling exclusively to third parties as opposed to internal transfers between Timberland and a mill, which I think gives us much better market historical market information on logs.
We use that information to develop historical real log price averages, which when we talk about log prices being high, what we are saying is those current log prices were above those historical averages, so we put the pedal to the metal and harvest. Alternatively when long prices get below those historic averages, we lighten up, we're limited on that because the contractor availability but I would also say because of our size we're able to be more nimble than anyone else and take advantage of these various buckets of harvest or Timber that we have to grow outside the market on close or adjust to market realities."
Operator,1,"And next will go to Steve Olson, a Private Investor."
Unidentified Analyst,1,"The couple of real-estate segment related questions and longer term, what are the opportunities to transfer additional land into the 2,100 acres or they are about of higher and better used lands? I'm not sure on Slide 18 the last bullet is referencing the possibility of additional Timberland being transferred into that segment?"
Tom Ringo,1,"I think the opportunity that come from two sources, one is overtime as other markets that we currently owned land in or purchase land in the private equity business move in becomes suburbanize or subject to more urbanization. I think there is a chance to do that probably our lands in Jefferson County and maybe some in Sutton County and some more even on the East side and South in Southwest Washington had a chance to move into the real-estate bucket. But we're also -- Bainbridge landing is a significant indicator that we are also looking for opportunities where by a local expertise and reputation providers opportunity for unusual need robust opportunities on properties that we don’t currently owned. So, that's why we think the Bainbridge landing deserves some special attention today."
Unidentified Analyst,1,And my second question is related to Bainbridge landing and I guess the village centered the commercial development whether or not that might be developed in a joint venture type transaction versus the sale. Are these assets like Bainbridge? Is that a longer term hold? Do you view yourself as a developer and a holder of the income producing property or a seller after it stabilizes?
Tom Ringo,1,"We are viewing that property and that particular property unless this development class, we first studied in terms of what would that look like with the shorter term hold after just getting the stabilization, whether or not the Company looks at holding on to a long-term will be decided at that time depending on how many of these things we have, and whether or not it make sense to continue to build the pipeline of these projects, that's something that we're going to put off a decision on until we get to a little further down in the -- that in the rising pipeline of the projects. The village center is definitely a candidate for a joint venture type of project and we are looking at that disturbing that right now."
Unidentified Analyst,1,"And a quick question on the Timber, the Carbon River acquisition I guess it's been almost two years since that acquisition. It probably with the strong log pricing I would imagine that has worked that well I think you are anticipating to get about 1.5 million of cash flow per year after the debt service. Should we think about that is a sustainable, 4 million board feet? Could you pay the higher price per acre on that, but would that property be retaining that price? Or how should we think about that land or will that have a harvest for an initial period of time and then decline?"
Daemon Repp,1,"This is Daemon Repp. I'll take that. So, yes, as you accurately pointed out in 2016 when we acquired the Carbon River Tree Farm, it increased our sustainable cut from 48 million to 52 million feet and that is an increase that we expect to continue into perpetuity. And it was certainly a beneficial time for us to increase our sustainable cut given where log prices have been since we bought that tree farm."
Unidentified Analyst,1,"I guess there’s conflicts with Fund IV as far as another acquisition, but it would appear that that acquisition has added to unit value and you’re pleased with that?"
Tom Ringo,1,"This is Tom. Yes, very pleased with that acquisition slipping that into the window between Fund III and Fund IV, as you’re noting when we’re in active a capital of placement mode for another tons, so tons get primacy in terms of the bigger opportunities for placing capital. We’re -- while Fund IV is active we continue to be active on the half of the partnership, in a small tract space, but a Carbon River type of acquisition was wonderfully timed between Funds III and IV and really glad that we were able to sight that one."
Operator,1,And that does conclude today’s question-and-answer session. I’d now like to turn the call back over to Tom Ringo for any additional comments or closing remarks.
Tom Ringo,1,"Thank you, operator, and again, thanks everybody for taking the time to listen to management's prepared remarks as well as submit questions. We really appreciate your interest in Pope Resources and like I said previously, this team is working hard every day to increase value, create new value on behalf of those who have taken the leap of faith to invest in this small company.
Thanks so much and have a great day and a great weekend."
Operator,1,"And that does conclude today’s conference. We thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect."
