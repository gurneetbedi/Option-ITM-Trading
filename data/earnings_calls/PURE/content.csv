Operator,0,"Welcome to the PURE Bioscience Third Quarter 2018 Results Conference Call. As a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode, and the conference is being recorded. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions [Operator Instructions].
I would now like to turn the conference over to Terri MacInnis, Vice President of Investor Relations at Bibicoff & MacInnis Inc. Please go ahead."
Terri MacInnis,0,"Thank you, operator and good afternoon everyone. It’s my pleasure to welcome you to the Company’s conference call to discuss fiscal Q3 financial and operating results, and an update on PURE's food safety business strategy. On our call today is Hank Lambert, Chief Executive Officer and Mark Elliott, VP Finance.
This afternoon, PURE issued a financial results press release and filed its quarter report on Form 10-Q, copies of which are available on the SEC's Web site and the Investor Relations page of PURE's Web site PUREbio.com. This call is being webcast live and recorded. A replay of the event will be posted later today on the Company's Web site and will remain available for at least 60 days following the call.
Our discussions today include forward-looking statements. These statements include certain assumptions made by PURE based on historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments, including business prospects, customer adoption, regulatory approvals, product and market development objectives, future financial performance and market share, and other factors PURE believes to be appropriate in the circumstances.
Risks and uncertainties may cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. You can find a discussion of these risks and uncertainties and more information about PURE in its filings with the SEC, including the Risk Factors section in the Company's 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K, in 10-Qs and in periodic filings on Form 8-K. As a result, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.
These forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this call, and PURE assumes no obligation to update these statements publicly, even if new information becomes available in the future. This broadcast is covered by U.S. copyright laws, and any use or rebroadcast of all or any portion of this conference call may only be done with the Company's expressed written permission.
On this call, we will refer to non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted net loss that when used in combination with GAAP results, provide us with additional analytical tools to understand our operations. We have provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the press release.
I will now turn the call over to Mark Elliott, Vice President of Finance. Mark?"
Mark Elliott,0,"Thank you, Terri. As we reported earlier today, in our Q3 fiscal '18 operating results and as previously discussed on prior conference calls, we continue to focus on building our commercialization efforts for our patented SDC technology as a food safety solution, while simultaneously managing our resources as effectively as possible.
We currently have funding in place to support our operations through fiscal year 2018; accelerate the commercialization of SDC-based PURE Control as an FDA-approved direct food contact processing aid for fresh produce; and an FDA and USDA-approved processing aid for raw poultry; accelerate the commercialization of PURE Hard Surface for the sanitization of food transport trucks and pallets; and further accelerate the development of PURE Hard Surface as a food contact surface disinfectant for both the food processor and restaurant chain markets.
I will now discuss our fiscal Q3 and year-to-date 2018 operating results. Net product sales for the third fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2018 were $390,000, an increase of 15% compared with net product sales of $338,000 for the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2017. Revenues from our core business, food safety, increased 35% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in total revenue was due to new customer adoption.
Total operating costs and expenses, excluding cost of goods and share-based compensation for the third quarter ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, were $1.4 million and $1.5 million respectively. Net loss, excluding derivative income and share-based compensation for the third fiscal quarter in 2018, was $1.1 million as compared with $1.3 million for the third quarter in 2017.
Net product sales for nine months ended April 30, 2018 were $1.265 million, a decrease of 4% compared with net product sales of $1.316 million for the nine months ended April 30, 2017. Core food safety revenues decreased by 8% as compared with food safety revenues during the nine months ended 2017. The decline in both total and food safety revenues was due to the timing of product orders as the initial system-wide stocking order from Chipotle occurred in Q1 of fiscal 2017.
If we back out Chipotle's initial order, food safety sales would be up over 40% for the nine months ended April 30 2018. Total operating cost and expenses, excluding the cost of goods sold and share based compensation for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017 were $4.5 million and $4.7 million respectively. Net loss, excluding derivative income, inducement expense and share-based compensation for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 was $3.7 million as compared to $3.9 million for the nine month period in 2017.
We ended the third quarter with a cash position of $1 million. Cash received from financing activities during fiscal ’19 with $2.6 million, offset by cash used in operating and investing activities of $3.3 million. In management’s effort to prudently manage our cash position and our opportunities against the anticipated revenue flow. In fiscal Q3, management implemented a number of wide-ranging cost cutting initiatives to reduce expenses and bring down our cash flow breakeven point.
We now target an annual revenue breakeven run rate of approximately $7 million. These overhead reductions were made in various areas, including board and management compensation, as well as vendor fees. Marketing expenses were essentially cut in half, but only in areas that do not directly impact our sale, or customer related activities. The board continues to actively evaluate our future financing needs and assess the various types of opportunities available to us to meet those needs and to allow us to achieve our previously stated cash flow breakeven target in calendar Q1 2019. No future financing determinations have been made at this time regarding size, type, or timing.
This concludes my financial review. I will now turn the call over to Hank for the progress update of our business strategy. Hank?"
Hank Lambert,0,"Thanks, Mark and good afternoon, everyone. We certainly appreciate you for joining us for today's discussion. As Mark mentioned, adjusting for Chipotle's large initial system wide stocking order in the fiscal Q1 of 2017, our core food safety revenues have shown consistent strong double-digit growth, thereby, validating our strategic focus and the game changing nature of our SDC-based solutions.
In fiscal Q3 2018, Chipotle reorders have begun to ramp, normalizing the inventory turn. Based on this, the expense control actions Mark discussed and the three initiatives I'll address now, we remain confident that we will achieve a cash flow break even run rate in calendar Q1 2019. Our cash flow breakeven production is based on three components; first, Taylor Farms rollout plan for FDA approved PURE control in produce processing for calendar 2018 and beyond; second, the encouraging feedback from our food transportation customers led by Cisco using EPA approved PURE Hard Surface Disinfectant; and third, the continued addition and expansion of use of Pure hard surface at food processors, manufacturers and restaurant chains.
These three segments are in addition to our base of approximately $2 million in existing annual sales. Taylor Farms is the largest U.S. produce processor, and our first customer for PURE control, our direct food contact antimicrobial, which is applied directly on to food. The long-awaited use expansion is underway as Taylor continues to employ capital to support the rollout and use of PURE Control into its 14 plant network.
As discussed previously, Taylor Farms is using PURE Control as an added processing step to enhance food safety by eliminating pathogens, causing food borne illness, including the leading causes of Salmonella, E. coli, and Listeria. We estimate each of those plants represent approximately $1 million per year in revenue. In other words, an annual $14 million opportunity when fully deployed.
Today, PURE Control is used by Taylor Farms to process produce on four lines in two plants in Salinas California. The next phase of the rollout will be completed by the end of June with the expansion to seven lines in one of the Salinas plants, bringing the total number of lines to nine in two plants. As Taylor customer adoption grows, additional plants will be brought online in the coming months.
The source of the romaine lettuce contaminated with E. coli that resulted in 197 illnesses and five deaths, still has not and will likely never be identified. That recent outbreak, as well as the salmonella outbreak linked to melons last week, has once again put the produce industry under the microscope, highlighting the urgent need for a more effective processing aid. It has also accelerated interest from processors and provided us with a wider stage from which to champion our much-needed game changing solution. We are actively following up on multiple leads.
I’m pleased to say that things are progressing so well with Taylor Farms that we are in discussions with them about strengthening and formalizing our strategic partnership. I'm not at liberty to discuss with the initiative in anymore detail today, but I expect to make an announcement before our fiscal year-end in July. Today, we also have eight additional produce processors conducting or evaluating their own in-house validation and optimization testing. This is standard industry produce before placing our first order. We reiterate our goal is to attain at least five new produce processor customers for PURE Control by the end of calendar 2018.
Now, I’ll discuss food transport sanitization, our newest market for Pure Hard Surface disinfectant, which represents an estimated $50 million total addressable market opportunity. Our first two transportation customers, including Cisco for trucks, represent $2 million to $3 million annual revenue opportunity for us when fully deployed. Our sales and business development teams are targeting the more than 200,000 refrigerated and non-refrigerated food transport trucks in the U.S.
Cisco, the largest North American food distributor, has approved us for use system-wide in its 90 plus independent operating company's network. This network includes subsidiaries sigma and fresh point, which is North America's largest wholly-owned produce distributor. We sell directly into each operating company, and we performed the training and installation at each company individually. To-date, we’ve ship product and equipment to 14 of those operating companies, and we are averaging in addition of at least one new company each week.
Our goal is to be in 50% of Cisco’s system by winter, and build from there into our $2 million to $3 million annual revenue opportunity. Word-of-mouth for users is what drives interest, and we are ganging traction. Beyond Cisco, we continue discussions and testing with other transportation operators, and we are actively presentation our truck sanitization solution to more than a half of dozen other food transport companies.
Last quarter, we told you that among processors, Taylor Farms is using truck sanitization solution. Taylor is also expanding its use of PURE Hard Surface by developing a new application and protocols for the produce transport bins used to bring harvested product from the field to the processing plants. We look forward to having more information on this initiative in our next quarterly call.
The FDAs is ruled under the food and safety modernization act, required food transport companies to have sanitization protocols in place by April 2018. Food transport companies need to find a safe, cost effective and superior disinfectant. PURE Hard Surface is the perfect solution as the FDA steps up audits of food transport companies to ensure compliance. PURE Hard Surface achieved several compelling competitive advantages for disinfecting refrigerated and non-refrigerated trucks. It is mist spray applied as a non-toxic disinfection treatment to a trailer, and its refrigeration unit. Generating, a dramatic five lawn pathogen reduction in just 15 minutes versus the two hours that now takes carriers or distributors to clean and sanitize the truck.
Off course, this results in significant labor savings and minimizes trailer downtime to get them back on the road with a significant added benefit of being non-corrosive to refrigeration units. In addition, we have demonstrated extended residual kill in food transport trucks.
Continuing our discussion of PURE Hard Surface, we are building upon the gains made in early fiscal Q3 when PURE Hard Surface was adopted by two household brand names in Unilever and Del Monte for plant environmental sanitization. And Taylor Farms began expanding environmental usage and applications within its network of plants. In the past month, we have added adoption by national brands, including Butterball, Ben & Jerry's and Chicken of the Sea. Our superior non-toxic SDC technology solutions drew keen interest from a variety of attendees last month when we exhibited at the food safety summit. We are actively working those new leads.
Attendees included retailers, food processors, distributors, manufacturers, growers and restaurant chains in addition to food safety professionals. Later this month, we will be exhibiting at the United Fresh Produce Expo in Chicago where we anticipate significant interest in PURE control as a solution to mitigate the risks of outbreaks like the recent romaine E.coli contamination. PURE Hard Surface for plant equipment and environmental disinfection is now in use by 80 national food manufacturers and processors in a wide range of industry segments, including produce, bakeries, pet food, cheese, dairy and meats. Our calendar 2018 goal is to increase that customer base to at least 100 users in this category.
We're currently adding new customers and plants at a study rate of an average of four per month. Restaurant chains continue to have particular interest in the superior ability of our patent at SDC technology to eliminate one of the leading causes of food-borne illness outbreaks Norovirus. In our last call, we told you that we expected in May a new blue-chip national casual dining chain to begin use of PURE Hard Surface throughout the chain. I am pleased to report that the cheese cake factory initial stocking order was booked in fiscal Q3, and in the month in the past month they have rollout usage to their entire 210 store system in U.S.
The Cheesecake Factory is currently using PURE front of house on dining tables and will add usage back of house in the coming months. We continue to expect, as mentioned last quarter, another new national restaurant chain to become a customer in fiscal Q4. We also are set to begin testing with yet another casual dining chain with operations in nine states. We look forward to announcements indicating achievement of our goal to add at least three new restaurant chain in calendar 2018.
Now, I will discuss PURE Control use in poultry processing where we have USDA approval for use of patented SDC up to 160 parts per million as PURE Control in pre-online reprocessing and post chill raw poultry processing. We continue in plant testing and validation efforts with major poultry processors for poultry parts, and expect that optimization work to continue through the calendar year.
Poultry parts represent approximately 75% of all poultry sold to consumers. It’s a large and very important market to us. We know of no other equally effective non-toxic solution, and believe PURE control is a breakthrough solution the poultry industry needs. In initial testing, PURE Control dramatically reduced salmonella at a rate that interventions currently being used are not consistently achieving. While ounce for ounce pure control will be more expensive than existing chemistries, we believe our total value proposition is compelling.
In addition to seeking a superior answer to reducing salmonella, the poultry processors that we have talk to and are working with are seeking ways to get rid of the legacy product PAA peracetic acid. Because of its toxicity and the fact that it's an irritant to employees, PAA, which is currently in general use as a negative impact on the environment and equipment, and has a negative impact on yield.
In summary, before turning to our Q&A session, we continue to have significant confidence that the overall revenues we need to get to cash flow breakeven and beyond are achievable our customers control the timing of any rollout. And based on their communications to us and evidenced by the investments they are making to implement our solutions, our path to cash flow breakeven is coming into clear focus. Our sales and marketing team consists of five direct sales and technical service personnel, which are augmented by existing strategic distributor and marketing partnerships.
In addition, we have relationships with industry experienced business development agents, as well as technical service and equipment groups who can assist with implementation. Overtime, as revenues build and can support it, we would certainly expand our direct sales and technical service teams internally.
I'd now like to turn our call over to Ariel our operator to begin the question-and-answer session."
Operator,1,"Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from [Dan Kaplan], a Private Investor."
Unidentified Analyst,1,"I appreciate all the efforts, and you’ve got an expressive list of prospects that you’re hoping can lead to breakeven. I think you said by first quarter calendar 2019?"
Hank Lambert,1,Correct.
Unidentified Analyst,1,"I don’t need to remind you guys were five years into this. And from a shareholders perspective, the numbers are still pretty abysmal. I recognize that you got all these opportunities. So let’s just talk about where we are today and what the investors are looking at. The revenues really are not -- you’re running out of cash, the good news is you’re cutting your comp and other expenses, the bad news is this should have been done two years ago, we’re at $0.70 stock, which has basically shown no appreciation in the last few years. We can’t blame it on the market through the economy. And I am glad to hear that you’re finally sharing some pain of the investors. So could you go into a little detail about what you really are cutting, what it amounts to and your needs are to get the additional financing. And what impact and dilution it might have on your current investors, in lightness a little more as to dollars and cents here?"
Hank Lambert,1,"Sure, Sam, thank you and we certainly share your frustration and understand, and appreciate your patience. We really can't say too much more in terms of what our financing needs are and timing and what options we’re looking at. Clearly, we will have to raise some amount of additional funding, financing in order to fund operations, while we build towards cash flow breakeven in the first quarter of calendar 2019.
The cuts that we've made in expenses and as Mark indicated they come in the area of board and management compensation, as well as a number of vendors -- and we have also significantly cut our marketing expenditures that were not directly impacting our sales or customer facing efforts. So that has enabled us to bring down our cash flow breakeven revenue run rate from what we’d previously been indicating was $10 million to $12 million, down to the neighborhood of $7 million. So significant improvement in where we need to get to from a revenue run rate standpoint in order to hit cash flow breakeven. That's about as much detail as I can give you at this point. We will certainly be sharing our financing needs and the options that we’ll be pursuing as we move forward."
Unidentified Analyst,1,So it sounds like you’re going to need a couple of million dollars. Is that close?
Hank Lambert,1,I’d say that’s close. Yes.
Unidentified Analyst,1,Are you exploring any non-dilutive ways to accomplish this?
Hank Lambert,1,Yes.
Unidentified Analyst,1,"Okay, I won’t press any harder. Thanks for your efforts. And I am hoping that next quarter when we look at the financials there, they’re a little more appealing and the stock price is you know is doing a little bit better. So, thanks again guys."
Hank Lambert,1,"Thanks Dan, we firmly believe they will be."
Operator,1,"Our next question comes from [Stuart San], a private investor."
Unidentified Analyst,1,"Hi, good afternoon, following up to Stan's question. One of the ways I was wondering you might be able to help yourself, is you listed a bunch of new names that are pretty impressive that are using your product, including adding lines of Taylor Farms and so on. Is there any good reason that you don't announce those things during the quarter because as we know, a very few people listen to quarterly reports, although they maybe should."
Hank Lambert,1,"We're walking a fine line here. We really are working toward being in a position where we can do some joint press releases with a number of these new key blue chip companies. I mean, Taylor Farms we did a press release earlier this year on Taylor Farms with regard to Cisco and cheese cake factory and some of the others. We are working with them to do a joint press release as soon as they are comfortable doing that. They want to be in a position where the product has been sufficiently rolled out, and they have some experience with it before they issue that press release, but that's certainly something that we're working on and we expect to happen."
Operator,1,"Our next question comes from [Chris Conway], a private investor."
Unidentified Analyst,1,"My question is really -- the industry obviously there's more and more food borne illnesses, and food service issues. Obviously, you know all that with Chipotle, and all the stuff. Is there a particular reason a potential customer wouldn't engage. Your hitting so many interesting areas as far as non-toxic, more effective. These are great selling points when you use silver. Is there any particular pushback that you get from potential clients?"
Hank Lambert,1,"Our biggest competitor, to be honest, is the status quo. If companies do not perceive that they have a problem, they're very reluctant to bring a new chemistry into their operations or make any changes that would require them to retrain personnel or change their operations in any way. So until the company has a significant issue or believes they are about to have one and could end up in the headlines like a Chipotle, it's really difficult to break through to what they're currently doing.
And we have -- as you indicated, we have a very strong value proposition, with PURE Hard Surface we're very cost competitive with alternative legacy chemistries like chlorine dioxide, bleach, quaternary ammonia, hydrogen peroxide. However -- and the fact that we're non-toxic non-corrosive creative environmentally and user-friendly, but these companies unless they believe they have a problem, they think what they are doing is -- must be working so its very difficult to breakthrough. And when we have broken through, it’s required extensive lightly testing, which is just the frustrating to us as it clearly is to you, because we know we have a superior product, and there's no reason why they shouldn't bring us in. But it’s a struggle unless they really believe they have an issue."
Operator,1,Our next question comes from Lauren Chung of Westpark Capital.
Lauren Chung,1,"I apologize to the background noise. My question is -- so for your revenue ramp, is it more -- are you focusing on the volume orders from the clients that you on-boarded in the quarter? Or is it a function of, obviously adding more clients as you can? But also as question for the new clients, I mean, what was the differentiating factor that propelled onto what your product or your -- use your products in conjunction the way the status quo?"
Hank Lambert,1,"The answer to the first part of your question is that we have a roadmap to get to cash flow breakeven based on the ramp -- the volume ramp with our current portfolio of customers. And again, as indicated Taylor Farms, Cisco, our new restaurant chain customers, those are the ramp with those customers is what is going to get us to cash flow breakeven. New business that we gain will be incremental to that.
So while we’re looking to both sources for revenue growth, we can see our way to cash flow breakeven just based on the ramp with our existing customer base. The reasons why the customers that we’re currently working with that brought us in range from what I was referring to earlier as companies that either know they have a problem and may have been in the headlines, or believe they could have a problem, and have brought us in to solve the problem that they either have or believe they’re going to have. And that would apply to, for example, Chipotle.
With Taylor Farms and Pure Control for produce, we are incremental intervention to what they're currently doing. So the compelling value proposition for Taylor and other produce processors was the fact that we can provide incremental pathogen kill to what they're currently doing. We’ve been able to consistently demonstrate that and the fact that we are non-toxic, non-corrosive to their equipment and the economics worked. So clearly, looking at this latest romaine outbreak, for example, which was not the reason why Taylor brought us in. We've been working with Taylor for three years. But in event like that really drives home of the fact that what produce processors are currently doing is not working effectively. And we have demonstrated that we can provide incremental pathogen kill to what they're currently doing. So that's a very compelling reason to bring us in."
Operator,1,This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Hank Lambert for any closing remarks.
Hank Lambert,1,"Thanks, Ariel. We truly appreciate your interest and patience as we grow ever closer to that inflection point we've all been waiting for, and I'm optimistic about the success of our company when I look at our pipeline and runway as we've been discussing. We continue to acknowledge and appreciate the patience of our shareholders have shown as we gain attraction behind our industry changing solutions. And we have a high degree of confidence -- and that we are on the threshold of cash flow breakeven. I look forward to reporting our continued progress to you on our next call. Thanks again for joining us, and have a great day."
Operator,1,This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines. Thank you for participating. And have a pleasant day.
