Operator,0,"Good day, everyone, and welcome to LATAM Airlines Group Earnings Release Conference Call. Just a reminder, this conference is being recorded. LATAM Airlines Group earnings release for the period was distributed on Tuesday, November 20. If you have not received it, you can find in on our website at www.latamairlinesgroup.net in the Investor Relations section.
At this time, I would like to point out that statements regarding the company's business outlook and anticipated financial and operating results constitute forward-looking statements. These expectations are highly dependent on the economy, the airline industry and international markets. Therefore, they are subject to change.
Now it is my pleasure to turn over the call to Mr. Ramiro Alfonsín, Chief Financial Officer of LATAM Airlines Group. Mr. Alfonsín, please begin."
Ramiro Alfonsín,0,"Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to LATAM Airlines' third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Ms. Claudia Sender, Vice President of Customers; Mr. Roberto Alvo, Chief Commercial Officer, Mr. Jerome Cadier, CEO of LATAM Airlines Brazil and Mr. Andrés Del Valle, Vice President of Corporate Finance.
We had a very challenging third quarter for LATAM and for the industry as fuel prices continued to increase. Prices rose 36% year-over-year representing $185 million, additional cost for LATAM in third quarter versus last year.
In addition, demand slowdown influenced by the situation in Argentina and in Brazil with the severe devaluation of their respective currencies. In this challenging environment, LATAM did not lose focus of its cost initiative and managed to offset part of the circumstances that affected the economic results. Initiatives under our control were successfully implemented and improved the results we anticipated.
Please turn to Slide 2 where you will find the highlights for the third quarter. Operating income for the quarter amounted to $175 million representing an operating margin of 7%. After July 1, 2018, the Argentine economy was considered for purposes of IFRS at hyperinflationary. In an hyperinflationary environment financial statements must be expressed in the functional currency adjusted by inflation since the beginning of the year and converted to the exchange rate of the end of the reporting period instead of the spot exchange rate a delay of each transaction.
This means that the best denominated financial statement of our Argentine subsidiaries have been converted at 41 pesos per dollar instead of the 25 pesos per dollar representing each day of transactions. This accounting and non-cash effect reflects approximately 100 million lower revenues and 90 million lower costs.
In order to better reflect the performance of our passenger operations without the hyperinflationary accounting effect, the operating figures of RASK and CASK and only those that we will discuss during this call exclude the impact of this accounting effect. The variations of RASK and CASK does include the effect of IAS 21 and IAS 29 are included in our press release and in the notes of this presentation.
Total revenue for ASK for the third quarter declined 6.3% mainly driven by passenger revenues from international operations influenced by the devaluation and high volatility of the Brazilian real and the Argentinean pesos. On the other hand, total operating expenses fell 3.5% and cost per ASK decreased 5.2% despite the 32% increase in fuel cost which represent now 32% of our total operating costs.
Cost per ASK ex-fuel decreased 16% year-over-year. We are consistently capturing efficiencies all over the organization to offset the pressures that are beyond our control. Cost efficiencies put the company in a good competitive stand, and allow us to improve our performance when demand recovers.
We continued also to improve the utilization of our aircrafts from 10.1 hours to 10.6 hours in the third quarter. In addition, during the next 18 months we will increase seat count in the narrow-body feet by 3%.
Improving utilization and seat count is allowing us to grow with fewer aircrafts and therefore will help us to keep the positive track in cash flow generation and continue our deleveraging plan.
Having this in mind, we continued our efforts to adjust our fleet commitments. We have reduced 2.3 billion of fleet commitments for the period 2018 and 2021. With this reductions, we have a fleet plan that better matches the current demand environment.
Another important milestone in this quarter was that after more than two and a half years, the Chilean free competition court approved the JBA between LATAM and American Airlines and IAG. This is good news for all our stakeholders and especially for our passengers. As this agreement have demonstrated to bring benefits such as direct destinations, better schedules and fares, seamless connection and more flights.
We will be able to integrate our passenger and cargo network between South America and the U.S. and Canada with American and between South America and Europe with IAG which will result in much more efficient operation. This resolution from the antitrust authorities has been appealed to the Supreme Court by certain third-parties.
I also wanted to take this opportunity to give you an update on the transaction between LATAM Airlines Brazil and Multiplus. As you know on September 5, our subsidiary LATAM Airlines Brazil announced its intention to offer - to acquire all common shares in Multiplus that it does not currently own representing approximately 27% of the total shares with the intention to manage its frequent flyer program in-house in the future.
We have now submitted the required documentation to the CVM in October and we are on track according to our schedule expecting to carry on with the tender offer during the first quarter of 2019.
Last but not least, we are very proud to be included in the world category of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the fifth consecutive year representing one of the only three airlines groups in this category globally and the only one in the Americas.
Turning to Slide 3, you will find a summary of our income statement. Total revenues of the company declined by 5.8% in the third quarter to 2.5 billion as a result of the decreasing passenger and other revenues. On the passenger-side, revenues per ASK fell 6.3% in dollar terms mainly as a result of the devaluation and the volatility of the currencies in the region affected mainly our international business.
In particular as a result of [indiscernible] industry capacity [indiscernible] between Brazil and U.S. We continue to see a good performance of our new service model. The Spanish speaking countries RASK increased 0.2% despite Argentina which was influenced by currency and economic uncertainty. In Brazil domestic operations revenue per ASK increased by 11% in local currency year-over-year despite the 2.1 percentage point decline in load factor. We have therefore decided to expand our new sales model to our international operations.
Other revenues fell by 42 million in the quarter due to the impact of the devaluation on Multiplus revenues and due to fewer aircrafts under sub leased compared to last year third quarter. Cargo revenues on the other hand amounted to $279 million continued to show a recovery increasing 2.5% year-over-year.
Total cost declined by 3.5% in the quarter to 2.3 billion despite an increase of $185 million in fuel expenses. During this quarter we have reduced headcount by 1,700 employees and continue to increase utilization of our aircrafts.
As a result, cost per ASK ex-fuel decreased by 16% year-over-year. We are very happy to see our cost initiatives on track and producing results and we wanted to thank our employees for their efforts and our customers for their continued support.
With all this, our operating income for the quarter was $175 million accounting for 7% operating margin. The non-operating result amounted to $140 million loss in the third quarter compared to the $40 million loss in the third quarter of 2017. This is explained by a 68 million foreign exchange loss during this quarter while in the third quarter 2017 we had a 59 million foreign exchange gain. With that, net income amounted to $53 million in the third quarter.
If we take a look at the year-to-date figures on the right-hand side of the slide, revenues increased 2.5%. During the year, we had $483 million increase in our fuel costs and ASKs grew 4.5%. Cost ex-fuel decreased 9.1% year-to-date. Despite the fuel impact, operating income is just $35 million below last year's. Net income for the nine months ended in September 2018 was $33 million, including $146 million foreign exchange loss in the period while in the same period 2017, LATAM recorded a net income of $88 million including a foreign exchange gain of $48 million.
Finally, I just want to mention that we’re still evaluating the effect of IFRS16 in our financials. We have a preliminary estimation of approximately one percentage point higher than last 12 months EBIT margin as of September 2018. In terms of leverage, our current 4.6x adjusted net debt to EBITDAR would be approximately reduced to 4.3x.
With that, I would like to turn the call to Andrés Del Valle, our Vice President of Corporate Finance."
Andrés Del Valle,0,"Thank you, Ramiro, and good morning everyone.
Please turn to Slide 4. Looking at each of our business units you can see that international operations were affected most. They have represented approximately 57% of our total ASKs during this quarter and we had a capacity growth of 8.3%. This is mostly driven by the new destinations launched from Brazil through the year such as Lisbon, Rome, and Boston. Traffic was up 2.7% and load factors declined 4.5 percentage points to a still healthy 83.3%.
The decline in load factor was driven mainly by fewer Argentina passengers due to the recent Argentina Pesos devaluation and volatility and by long-haul routes from Brazil especially to the U.S. As a result, revenues per ASKs were $0.06, 65% lower than the same quarter of last year. Revenues generated in U.S. and Europe accounted for 18% of our total revenues in third quarter 2018 compared with 16% in the same period of 2017.
If we look at the domestic Brazil operations which represents 26% of our total ASKs, total capacity increased by 2.5% mainly at our São Paulo hub. When we look at the load factor which reached 81.6%, a 2.1 percentage points decline is mainly written by the efforts of the Company to increase yields promoting all pass-through. In local currency, revenue per ASK grew 11.2% while measured in U.S. dollar terms revenue per ASK declined 9.5% to $0.057.
Once we look at the Spanish Speaking Countries domestic operations which altogether represent 17% of our total passenger capacity, capacity rose 3.6% with growth in all countries except Argentina. Traffic grew 3.3% resulting in a 0.3 percentage points decline to 81.4%. Revenues for ASK remain relatively flat at $0.071 with operations in Chile, Colombia, and Peru offsetting vast declines in Argentina, in part due to the depreciation of the Argentina Peso.
As a result, our overall passenger capacity grew by 5.9% year-over-year this quarter. Revenues per ASK declined 6.3% year-over-year and the load factor reached 82.5%. Once we go to the cargo side, our capacity rose by almost 4% this quarter, and we saw load factors at 53.5%, 0.7 percentage points lower than the third quarter of last year which coupled with flat yields resulted in a 1.4% decline in revenues per ATK. This decline reflects the impact of the currency devaluation in imports to Brazil and Argentina while exports continue to show improvements compared to last year mainly looking at that Salmon out of Chile.
Please turn to Slide 5. During the past years we have been working very hard to address our cost structure. On the top of the slide you can see that LATAM today continues to expand its operations and transport more passengers while with much leaner organization. Notably in the third quarter, despite 53% increase in fuel cost, overhead cost declined 3.5% year-over-year to $2.3 billion. This reduction is explained by efficiencies across the organizations together with the depreciation of local currencies and costs denominated on those currencies.
If we exclude fuel cost, our total cost would have declined by 14.6%. Fuel cost rose 32.9% in the quarter as a result of 28% increase in the price paid per gallon excluding hedge together with a 6.3% increase in fuel gallons consumed. Cost associated with wages and benefits decreased 23.3% or $123 million year-over-year as savings, mainly driven by a reduction of 4.1% in the headcount of the quarter as you can see in the chart at the top of the slide, and the 25% and 85% of the devaluation of the Brazilian and Argentina currencies respectively.
If you look at the fleet cost which include aircraft rentals, depreciation and amortization and maintenance expenses, those were down by 6.7% year-over-year in the quarter in line with the decline in the previous quarter and mainly explained by the lower redelivery cost as the Company did not return any aircraft in period, while in the same period of last year six aircrafts were returned.
Lastly, the other cost on this slide declined 13.8% despite increase passenger and cargo operations as a result of our efficiency initiatives being implemented. As a result, cost per ASK decreased by 5.2% to $0.065, while cost per ASK ex-fuel declined by 16.1% year-over-year to $0.044.
Please turn to Slide 6. I want to give you an update regarding our new sales model implemented in our six domestic markets since 2017. We believe that this is a correct approach to compete in our markets effectively. As you know domestic passengers represent more than 75% of the total passengers carried by LATAM, so a major portion of the passengers have been buying the tickets under this new model and paying for the services they need.
In this slide, you can see that we carried approximately 750,000 more passengers in our domestic operations in the nine months through September 2018, compared to last year. We carried more passengers in all our markets with exception if Argentina, where we have decided to cut capacity this year. In terms of our market share, during this year we have maintained and even increased our market share in countries where we have low-cost competitors since mid-2017 and the beginning of 2018, such as Chile, Peru and Argentina.
If you look at the load factors in every country we have been able to maintain load factors of over 8%, and those are equal or higher than the ones from our low-cost competitors in each market. Overall, our load factor is 81% in our domestic operations and rest in the Spanish speaking countries was flat over the nine months, and increased by 7% in domestic Brazil in local currency in the same period.
Our new sales model and our cost efficiencies are producing results and we have a much differentiated offer. In addition, we offer international connections and network that best serves the passengers, key slots at the main airports in the region and the largest frequent flyer program.
Since October, we expanded our new sales model to our international operations. Now our passengers in the international markets can purchase the tickets with the same flexibility that they currently have in their domestic flights paying for the service that they use and value the most. Under this model, we will be able to continue to stimulate the demand and drive the growth of air travel in South America. We will also benefit from a continuous increase in the ancillary revenue generation. Lastly, we believe that we are a very solid and proven competitor resilient in different market conditions.
Please turn to Slide 7, part of our cost efficiencies came from higher depreciation of our existing assets. We're looking to further improve the utilization and to grow in ASKs with the same assets to increase in seats per aircraft. We are able to announce in part for this year with a fleet commitments reduction. If you look at the expected fleet arrival schedule you can see that the changes that Ramiro mentioned earlier at the beginning of the presentation, we extended the arrival of 25 aircraft up to 2021 both narrow and wide body models.
Those 25 aircraft represent approximately $2.3 billion a reduction for the period, which means that that we have reduced fleet commitments by roughly 41% for the period 2018 to 2021, compared to last quarter's fleet plan. We expect that for 2018 all the deliveries will be under operating lease contracts, so no CapEx related to fleet in 2018.
For next year 2019, we will evaluate different options. It should be mentioned that approximately $0.5 billion out of the $1.1 billion has already been financed. We believe that this plan gives us the flexibility to adopt our growth in different market conditions. And this cautious view has allowed us to continuously improve our cash flow of investments, helping us to maintain our debt profile control and a healthy liquidity level.
If you turn to Slide 8, you can see that we've reached $956 million of free cash flow of investments in the last 12 months. The discipline of our investments especially fleet investments has been the main driver of this cash flow generation. It is worth mentioning that 2017 was a year with historically low investment for LATAM, so the comparison against last year it has hardened now. We remain focused and committed with the deleveraging process of the Company, taking a disciplined approach towards our investments.
Please turn to Slide 9. You can see our metrics. Regarding our financial metrics shown on this slide, our total gross debt was down by roughly $300 million to $7.6 million compared to December 2017, reaching a leverage ratio of 4.6x. We continue having a very good liquidity position with $1.2 billion of cash in hand plus $600 million of revolving credit facility.
The RCF is totally undrawn as of today. With this LATAM's liquidity position reached 17% of last 12 months revenues as of Q3. Our debt maturity profile shown at the bottom of slide shows a remainder of around $300 million in 2018, of debt maturities and $941 million for 2019.
Our weighted average cost of debt is around 4.5%, as the major portion of the debt is asset backed. In terms of interest rates approximately 60% of our debt is fixed, which is a significant portion in the current context of rising interest rates.
Please turn to Slide 10. Here we can see our fuel hedging portfolio. As of third quarter of 2018, our hedge position was 44% of our estimated fuel consumption. For the coming months, we have hedged a good portion of our fuel consumption. For fourth quarter 2018, we have about 54%, and moving into 2019 we have about 40% for the first-half.
Please turn to Slide 11. The Free Competition Court in Chile approved the JBA's between LATAM and American Airlines and IAG. This is a very important milestone after more than 2.5 years since we subscribed the agreements. These agreements are an opportunity to ensure growth for the industry and will bring remarkable benefits to all stakeholders especially our passengers. Under this agreements, we will be able to offer network of over 420 destinations for passengers compared with the 140 destinations that we currently operate.
In addition we will be able to launch new direct destinations from South America to the U.S. and Canada and to Europe. Furthermore, we will offer better fares and schedules. Once we implemented JBA's, we will share the revenues with our partners in the traffic between both regions, including the destinations behind and beyond because this is a mutual agreement. This means that we will split revenue irrespective of who operates the flight.
So we will work together with our partners to improve the network and better serve the connecting traffic both for passengers and cargo. Despite that the antitrust authorities decision was appealed by certain third parties to the Supreme Court of Chile, the U.S. Department of Transportation is now reviewing the agreement between LATAM and American Airlines, while we evaluate the implementation with IAG and routes Europe.
Finally if you turn to Slide 12, we affirm the guidance provided in the previous quarter. We are expecting total capacity to grow between 4% to 6% this year. This is composed by a 5% to 7% target for international segment, 2% to 4% goal for domestic Brazil, and 4% to 6% for domestic Spanish speaking countries operations.
We are also expecting cargo capacity to increase between 1% to 2% this year. As a result, we expect our operating margin to be between 6.5% to 8% this year. Third quarter was undoubtedly very challenging and market conditions were tough. However, our plans are producing results and we were able to offset conditions beyond and control. In addition, we are continuing to prepare comfortable for the future, strengthening balance sheet and ensuring future cash flow generation and growth.
This concludes our presentation for today, and we'll be happy to open the line for questions. Thank you."
Operator,1,[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Michael Lindenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Mike Lindenberg,1,"A couple of questions here, Ramiro. When you started out with your commentary you characterized as demand having slowed in Argentina and Brazil and if we look back in the third quarter that was during a period where we saw energy crisis hit a peak and we saw some of the currencies hit a trough. As we look into the fourth quarter and even into 2019, have the trends - have the revenue or demand trends have they stabilized somewhat? Have they gotten better from maybe where they bottomed in the third quarter? Any color that you could give us on where current trends are - current revenue trends in demand and I'm specifically referencing Argentina and Brazil long haul."
Ramiro Alfonsín,1,"Hi, Mike. Thank you for your question. I think Roberto is in better position to give you more color."
Roberto Alvo,1,"So let me go by market in Argentina and particular I think we're seeing healthier domestic demand and we believe that some of the demand that would have gone to international moved to domestic markets because of the devaluation and the higher cost of traveling abroad. We have not seen yet a rebound in international demands in Argentina and we believe we'll still see the weakness for a few more months.
In the case of Brazil, I think we're seeing quite healthy levels of demand today in domestic Brazil, I think it was reflected on the third quarter numbers on the one side and also positive action in domestic Brazil we're seeing strong demand as compared to last year.
Internationally still somewhat affected, I would say that the main challenges in international are related to a very important increase in capacity both to the U.S. and Europe. Although we're starting to see on an industry level a slow-down in capacity growth to the U.S. and even a slight decrease when you look at what's been published in the second quarter of 2019 already.
Capacity to Europe is still high in the double-digits for the whole industry fleet. So situation is stable in terms of demand international. We are starting to see slight improvement and I think our biggest concern today is imbalance between that - timid rebound in demand as compared to the capacity that are still very strong."
Mike Lindenberg,1,"Then just some questions over to Andrés. Just two quick ones here. The fuel hedge, the 40% position for the first-half of 2019, can you give us a sense of where those contracts were struck with those - at what price?"
Andrés Del Valle,1,"We typically do not disclose all the price but now given the most recent I think decrease on fuel prices that are still in the money, but we do not reveal exactly the strike price."
Mike Lindenberg,1,"Okay, that's actually very helpful. And then secondly Andrés, you mentioned you highlighted on the joint business agreement the fact that it's now that there's certain third parties that are appealing the approval on that to the Supreme Court, and I can think back some of the court cases that we've had to deal with in Chile over the years, they tend to take some time.
Can you give us a sense, is this something that the Supreme Court can hear rather quickly or is this something where they are not even going to be able to present the facts and the full case to the Supreme Court for some time. Do you have any sense on the timing and how much this ultimately slows down the approval process?"
Ramiro Alfonsín,1,I’ll turn this over to Roberto.
Roberto Alvo,1,"This is Roberto again. It’s viable if you look at pass cases from Supreme Court it could take as little as five months and as long as a year. At this point in time the Supreme Court will set a hearing date and we will know better when that is set. So I think it's a matter of months what’s in front of us despite that and as mentioned in the deck here, we are evaluating particularly with IAG potential implementation outside of Chile of the JV. And please remember that’s still pending the DoT signing and therefore whatever the time it takes in Chile its runs in parallel with the approval with the DoT."
Mike Lindenberg,1,"So Roberto just to be clear, its good you brought up the U.S. DoT issue because U.S. DoT is looking at a lot of different cases right now. So I think everybody is backed up but from the European perspective it sounds like are you free and clear you could move actually quickly on what you could do with British Airways with IAG?"
Roberto Alvo,1,Counting Chile we have all the approvals but of course we have this issue in the Supreme Court so what we are analyzing - from a legal perspective its implementation outside of Chile in the first stage; we are still looking at it. We have no decision.
Operator,1,And our next question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please proceed.
Savi Syth,1,"Just a quick, first a quick follow-up on Michael question on international. Are you able to kind of give us a high level breakout of the RASK between shorter haul, the regional and the long haul segment?"
Ramiro Alfonsín,1,"Sorry, can you repeat the question Savi?"
Savi Syth,1,The RASK decline in the international if you can kind of break it out between long haul or regional to kind of get a sense of how much of a drag that long haul segment is having?
Ramiro Alfonsín,1,"Yes, so again RASK decrease is basically due to devaluation I think if you were to see international RASK in local currency for point for sales Brazil, that’s positive and where we see the main weakness today is Brazil to the U.S. more than Europe and regional."
Savi Syth,1,"And then just on the domestic Brazil side, third quarter RASK is really strong in the local currency term. Is that kind of clean core number and we could expect that going forward or how you thinking about that RASK level going forward?"
Andrés Del Valle,1,"It is a clean number. Remember that in the second quarter we had issues with the change of our PSF system in Brazil that was completely cleared out and had no impact that was measurable in the third quarter. And as I explained before, we are seeing healthy levels of demand going forward so it looks that the situation has stabilized in domestic Brazil."
Ramiro Alfonsín,1,"Savi for Spanish speaking country, I would like to add that if you take aside Argentina which was affected by the devaluation of the currency you would see a positive RASK in the remaining Spanish speaking country."
Savi Syth,1,And if might I ask just one last question that your Slide 6 is very helpful in evaluating how the business model changes has shown up. I was wondering if you could - we’ve discussed corporate share trends in Brazil in the past but I was wondering if you could cover for the other countries what you are seeing on the corporate side if its similar or if you are gaining or if you losing any ground on that side as a result of the business model change?
Roberto Alvo,1,"In most of our domestic countries we are seeing I would say a very stable corporate share, market share but we are increasing our market share particularly in domestic Colombia in the last year I would say. So in general we have kept the health level, we have increased slightly our market share in Brazil as well and Colombia in particular."
Operator,1,And our next question comes from Petr Grishchenko with Barclays. Please proceed.
Petr Grishchenko,1,First I want to follow-up on what you're seeing in Argentina. Can you maybe talk a little bit more of what you are seeing in terms of fares and yields and the progress on offsetting FX devaluation?
Roberto Alvo,1,"So in domestic Argentina now we're seeing increases very close to the inflation in domestic fares month-by-month. So I would say that there's a positive reaction in domestic demand in Argentina. For international, Argentina is a very important point of sale for us and for many other airlines and there has been substantial RASK pressure and fares pressure because of the tremendous devaluation. And we still see quite significant weakness in demand and fares coming up from Argentina."
Petr Grishchenko,1,"And I'm looking at the guidance and just noticed that your competitors in Brazil, so looking domestic market, the capacity increase that you are projecting is somewhat higher than that of your competitors. So I'm trying to understand – trying to reconcile that given the commentary we heard are fairly cautious in adding capacity given the impact on revenue management. So what are your thoughts and what gives you comfort that you can grow yields in Brazil given your assumptions on capacity additions?"
Roberto Alvo,1,"So for the fourth quarter or for the remainder of the year what we have published in the system is I would say very small capacity increase. We're only growing around 2.5% capacity for the remainder of the year. We'll provide capacity increase guidance for 2019 in a couple of months. So at this point in time we believe that actually capacities in industrial levels have slowed down a little bit when you see all carriers. And therefore, I would say that it's a little bit more stable in terms of capacity for the market in the very short-term."
Petr Grishchenko,1,The last question from me is just on the revolver. So [$300 million] can you just remind us if there's any restrictions or covenants on drawing that amount or it's kind of freely available to draw?
Andrés Del Valle,1,"There are no covenant on the revolving credit facility, it's fully undrawn and fully committed by banks."
Operator,1,And our next question comes from [Rafael Franco] with Bradesco. Please proceed.
Unidentified Analyst,1,"Hi, I have two questions on my side. The first one, I'd like to know the tender offer to do this Multiplus is maintained, given that the appraiser report suggests overpriced. And second, even now the reduction of the fleet commitments into 2021 and 55% of this reduction will happen actually in 2031. I was wondering if you could give a - the breakdown between narrow and wide-body aircrafts?"
Ramiro Alfonsín,1,"The breakdown on the fleet commitments is on our press release. So just not to bother anyone but it's fully available there. So you can see the amount of aircraft. But for 2019 I can tell you that we're planning on four wide-bodies from Airbus and two wide-bodies from Boeing and we're expecting seven narrow bodies for 2019, and you can see the remaining of the years per breakdown on the press release.
We're only receiving two wide-bodies in 2020, and we're expecting four wide-bodies in 2021. I couldn't listen your first question regarding Multiplus, could repeat it?"
Unidentified Analyst,1,Yes. I'd just like to know if the tender offer is maintained given that the appraisal report is now suggesting a lower price?
Ramiro Alfonsín,1,"At this point in time, if we move with the calendar that we have expected and announced and we moved fast, we wouldn't be changing the price of the tender offer."
Operator,1,And our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.
Duane Pfennigwerth,1,"Just going back to your fleet changes and the lower CapEx, how much of the reduction in CapEx is a function of aircraft deferrals, aircraft deliveries at a slower rate versus how you're choosing to finance those aircraft. In other words is this really just more operating leases or is this all a function of fewer deliveries?"
Roberto Alvo,1,"Thank you Duane for that question, let me clarify. It's not that we're reducing CapEx overall, we're changing the way we're investing. We’re investing more on the passenger side. During this year we're going to be investing and we’re going to finalize seven new international destinations, 27 new routes. We have invested on the new sales model and we’re investing and we have committed investment for the next two years from the new cabins. So we are changing all the layout of all our 777 so improving business class, improving economy class and all of narrow-body. In addition to this, we're investing in IT and digital to improve the customer experience.
On the fleet side and the way we’re financing of this investment is since we have seen that we have improved utilization and we're expecting more seats per aircraft with the growing - with improved utilization and certification of our airplanes. So we saw that we weren’t or we shouldn’t need as much airplanes as we had initially committed. So what you see on the press release is fleet commitment independently or how we’re financing those.
What Andrés said - for 2018 all of them will be financed sale and lease back and for 2019 we’re still deciding how much we're going to finance in sales and lease back and how many we're going to finance with our own financing. We’re seeing very good conditions for our own financing so we still need to make a decision. Let me be clear, what you're seeing on the press release and the reduction is all fleet commitments independently of how we're going to finance them."
Duane Pfennigwerth,1,"And then just from my follow-up on this hyperinflationary accounting change. Can you say are we seeing just the third quarter impact in those third quarter breakouts or is that the nine months impact just pushed into one quarter.
And then secondly what is it that triggered this - is it a function of the percentage of your revenue or the percentage of your cost base, in other words why would you have to take this accounting treatment whereas maybe some other peers do not?"
Roberto Alvo,1,"As you have seen this has a very little impact in margin only less than 10 million, 7 million in terms of margin. But it does affect the revenues and it does affect the cost. What you're seeing here is since the beginning of the year, the whole adjustment in this quarter and what you do is that you need to adjust all your figures to the inflation for the whole year since January to September.
But the most important effect is that all the conversion from our Argentina subsidiaries that have peso denominated balance sheet, you need to transform and you need our consolidated statement into dollars, balance sheet and you need to convert everything at the exchange rate at the end of September.
And this is what produces the most impact. So I would say that you're seeing this nine-month impact in this quarter and especially accentuated by the conversion rate that was very high and you need to use the end of the period exchange rate."
Duane Pfennigwerth,1,And then any idea why this would trigger for you and maybe not some peers is it just a function of what percent of revenue you source from there or is it some other trigger?
Roberto Alvo,1,"No, it's because we have a peso denominated subsidiary in Argentina and when you're seeing our figures, you see them in dollar terms. So when we consolidate this Argentina subsidiary, you’ll see it in dollars and you have these conversion rate."
Operator,1,And our next question comes from Manuela Echavarria with CrediCorp Capital. Please proceed.
Manuela Echavarria,1,"I have two questions, first, can you quantify how much of your cost reduction was related to FX. And then related to the issues with Rolls Royce, have you recovered all the fleet at this point in time and return of - with leases?"
Ramiro Alfonsín,1,The first question was can you repeat it.
Manuela Echavarria,1,"Yes, can you quantify how much of your cost reduction was related to FX?"
Ramiro Alfonsín,1,"Yes, thank you for that question. Actually more than 60% of our cash reduction is due to efficiencies to sustainable efficiencies that we have implemented during the past two years. And I would say a little bit more than one-third is due to FX with the devaluation of the currencies.
Regarding the Rolls Royce question, we currently have two planes on ground of the 24 we operate and we expect that by January next year all the planes will be flying and we have a full solution for our fleet."
Operator,1,[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from [Diego Torres with MCC]. Please proceed.
Unidentified Analyst,1,"I have two questions, the first one is regarding the debt maturity profile. I mean 50% of the debt comes due within the next three years. So could you provide any color in terms of extended debt maturity profile. And the other one is in terms of the minimum cash the company is considering to have I mean in terms of amount and all in terms of percentage of last 12-month sales? Thank you."
Andrés Del Valle,1,"Yes, I think on the debt maturity if you look - for 2018 we had over $1 billion of debt maturities for next year we have less than $1 billion at least 941 which is shown at the left lower side of that Slide 9.
So of course we are always looking at opportunities to possibly refinance and extend the debt profile, but with today's cash duration and today’s allegation on commitments given the fleet restructuring, we feel very confident that it's nothing to be done just we could do it on an opportunistic basis. So we see at a very healthy debt profile going forward for now. And the other question was on?"
Unidentified Analyst,1,Related to - I mean if you have any minimum cash position either in terms of amount and/or in terms of percentage of last 12 months release?
Andrés Del Valle,1,"Yes, we have reported now 17.4% I think cash in hand plus the RCF we expect to be around those safe levels or maybe a bit higher that can be end of the year. Our policy is to target around that 20%. This year of course we saw a very adverse macro environment which of course implied a lower margin with the same investment. So that's why I think once this I think comes back to normal we should see I mean higher levels of liquidity going forward."
Operator,1,"Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further question in queue. I'd like to thank you all again for joining us today. Please feel free to contact our Investor Relations Department if you have any additional questions. We look forward to speaking with you again soon."
Ramiro Alfonsín,1,"Thank you, goodbye."
